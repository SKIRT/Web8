This section explains how to install <tt>PTS</tt> on Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite). To run
<tt>PTS</tt> you need a proper python distribution and the <tt>PTS</tt> source code, which is publicly available from
GitHub.

- \subpage InstallMacGetPTS
- \subpage InstallMacSetUp

If you plan to use <tt>PTS</tt> to create movies of <tt>SKIRT</tt> results, then you need to install a command line
tool called "MEncoder". To install it, read the following guide:

- \subpage InstallMacMEncoder

To adjust or expand the <tt>PTS</tt> code, you just need a decent text editor -- preferably one with syntax
highlighting for Python source code. If you already have the Qt Creator development environment installed, perhaps
because you also work on the <tt>SKIRT</tt> code, then you can easily configure Qt creator to become your <tt>PTS</tt>
development environment. For instructions on how to install Qt Creator, refer to the <tt>SKIRT</tt> Installation Guide.

- \subpage InstallMacConfigureforPTS

If you plan working on an extensive part of PTS (or really any other python project), we can recommend the PyCharm IDE.
The PyCharm Community Edition is freely available from the <a
href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/">JetBrains</a> website, and contains a lot of powerful tools.

To generate updated versions of the <tt>PTS</tt> documentation, you need to install the documentation generation tools
also used for <tt>SKIRT</tt>. Refer to the the <tt>SKIRT</tt> Installation Guide.
