This section explains how to install <tt>PTS</tt> on Ubuntu Desktop 14.04. To run <tt>PTS</tt>
you need a proper python distribution and the <tt>PTS</tt> source code, which is publicly available from GitHub.

- \subpage InstallUbuntuPython
- \subpage InstallUbuntuGetPTS
- \subpage InstallUbuntuSetUp

If you plan to use <tt>PTS</tt> to create movies of <tt>SKIRT</tt> results, then you need to install a command line tool
called "MEncoder". To install it, read the following guide:

- \subpage InstallUbuntuMEncoder

To adjust or expand the <tt>PTS</tt> code, you just need a decent text editor -- preferably one with syntax
highlighting for Python source code. If you already have the Qt Creator development environment installed, perhaps
because you also work on the <tt>SKIRT</tt> code, then you can easily configure Qt creator to become your <tt>PTS</tt>
development center. For instructions on how to install Qt Creator, refer to the \c SKIRT Installation Guide.

- \subpage InstallUbuntuConfigureforPTS

To generate updated versions of the <tt>PTS</tt> documentation, you need to install the documentation generation tools
also used for <tt>SKIRT</tt>. Refer to the the <tt>SKIRT</tt> Installation Guide.
