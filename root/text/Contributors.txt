\section ContribMain Main contributors

The people listed in this section have contributed substantially to SKIRT and/or PTS (the Python toolkit for SKIRT),
where "substantially" is loosely defined as more than 1000 lines of C++ code, Python code, and/or documentation.

- <a href = "http://users.ugent.be/~mbaes">Maarten Baes</a> conceived of SKIRT and wrote the first several versions of
  the code. Nowadays he determines the strategic direction and supervises all further development. Once in a while, he
  contributes some nice new feature himself.

- <a href = "http://users.ugent.be/~pcamps">Peter Camps</a> overhauled the SKIRT code, readying the class design for
  further expansion. He is currently the main SKIRT developer and the chief software design architect, acting as a
  gatekeeper for all new code contributions. Peter also initiated the PTS effort and helps Maarten with the strategy
  decisions.

- Gert De Geyter developed FitSKIRT and contributed ideas and code segments to SKIRT and PTS.

- Sam Verstocken developed the multi-processing capability of SKIRT and is currently developing major new PTS modules
  for pre-processing obervational data and fitting panchromatic SKIRT models to these data.

- Dries Van De Putte developed the data-parallelization capability in SKIRT and will soon be working on fundamentally
  new capabilities of the SKIRT code. Stay tuned.
