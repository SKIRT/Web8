\section SKIRTIntro Introduction

<tt>SKIRT</tt> is a state-of-the-art software code for simulating continuum radiation transfer in dusty astrophysical systems,
such as galaxies and accretion disks. <tt>SKIRT</tt> employs the Monte Carlo technique to emulate the relevant physical
processes including scattering, absorption and emission by the dust. The code features a wealth of built-in geometries,
light source spectra, dust characterizations, dust grids, and detectors, in addition to various mechanisms for
importing models generated by hydrodynamical simulations. The configuration for a particular simulation is defined
at either at runtime with a user-friendly command-line interface, or with a graphical interface called <tt>SkirtMakeUp</tt>.

\section SKIRTFeatures Features

Among other things, <tt>SKIRT</tt>:

 - Handles any 3D geometry without limitation.
 - Includes many built-in components to specify the distribution of stars and dust.
 - And allows importing the results of a hydrodynamic simulation in various SPH, AMR, or Voronoi formats.
 - Offers full treatment of multiple anisotropic scattering, absorption and (re-)emission by interstellar dust.
 - Computes the temperature distribution of the dust and the thermal dust re-emission self-consistently,
   even for larger optical depths.
 - Handles any combination of dust mixtures, each with their own spatial distributions, and calculates
   the temperature of different grain size bins individually.
 - Takes into account the stochastic heating of small grains in non-equilibrium conditions.
 - Supports polarization of radiation by spherical dust grains.
 - Includes a suite of instruments for measuring the radiation field, mimicking real astronomical
   instrumentation such as imaging and 3D spectroscopic devices.
 - Operates efficiently in both memory consumption and CPU time.
 - Is heavily parallelized, supporting any combination of multiple threads (shared memory) and multiple processes
   (distributed memory), including a data parallelization mode that substantially reduces memory requirements.
 - Allows specifying simulation parameters in an interactive console Q&A session, by straigthforward editing
   of XML-based parameter files, or through a graphical user interface.

<tt>SKIRT</tt> is completely written in C++ and has been designed with well-defined programming interfaces between components.
Adding a new feature is usually as simple as adding another class; the user interface automatically adjusts to allow
configuring the new options.

The SKIRT source code is publicly available from <a href="https://github.com/SKIRT/SKIRT">the SKIRT repository</a>
at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub.com</a>.

\section SKIRTcomponents Components

The <tt>SKIRT</tt> source tree includes <tt>FitSKIRT</tt>, an extension of the <tt>SKIRT</tt> code that automatically fits a 3D model to
observed images of a dusty galaxy. <tt>FitSKIRT</tt> matches the output frames of <tt>SKIRT</tt> radiative transfer simulations
to the observed images, searching the model parameter space through a genetic algorithm. For each new individual
constructed by the genetic procedure, <tt>FitSKIRT</tt> performs a <tt>SKIRT</tt> simulation using the parameters defined by the
individual's genes. The resulting simulated images are compared with the observed target images, and the result
is fed back into the genetic algorithm as the quality measure for the individual.

As an other extension to <tt>SKIRT</tt>, the "Python Toolkit for SKIRT" (<tt>PTS</tt>) has been created to
help visualize and pre- and postprocess <tt>SKIRT</tt> data. <tt>PTS</tt> is available as an external
package via its own <a href="https://github.com/SKIRT/PTS">GitHub repository</a> and the documentation can be
found <a href="../pts/index.html">here</a>.
