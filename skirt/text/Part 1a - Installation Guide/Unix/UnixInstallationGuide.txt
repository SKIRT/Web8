This section explains how to install <tt>SKIRT</tt> on any Unix system, for example a server where you are given a personal account.
After you've followed the guidelines on this page, the <tt>SKIRT</tt> source code will reside locally on the system and so you
can obviously tweak it using your preferred text editor. For the easiest installation, all you have to do is follow the steps below:

- \subpage InstallSrcPacks
- \subpage InstallSrcGet
- \subpage InstallSrcQt
- \subpage InstallSrcBuild

However if you expect to modify or extend the <tt>SKIRT</tt> code on the Unix sytem in any but the most trivial ways and possibly want to 
share your changes with others, you should follow the instructions listed here:

- \subpage InstallSrcPacks
- \subpage InstallSrcGit
- \subpage InstallSrcGetDevelop
- \subpage InstallSrcQt
- \subpage InstallSrcBuild
