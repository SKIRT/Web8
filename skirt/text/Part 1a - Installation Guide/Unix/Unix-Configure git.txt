\page InstallSrcGit Configuring the source control client

Before using the \c git client, you should configure it with your user name and email address. This is
especially important if you plan to contribute code to the <tt>SKIRT</tt> repository. Perform the following commands,
replacing the placeholders with your own name and email address:

    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email yourname@organization.org
