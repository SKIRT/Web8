\page InstallMacDoxygen Installing the documentation generator

This section is only relevant if you wish to (re-)generate the <tt>SKIRT</tt> documentation.
The <tt>SKIRT</tt> documentation is generated from the source files by the free open source application Doxygen. 
It requires the Dots tool in the Graphviz graph visualization software to generate class diagrams.

<i> Step-by-step instructions: </i>

<b> Installing Doxygen </b>

- Go to the <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html">Doxygen download page</a>.
- Scroll down and download the binary distribution for Mac OS X 10.5 and later (Doxygen-1.8.9.1.dmg).
- If the download is complete, open the '.dmg' file. This will mount the Doxygen installation disk.
- In the Finder window that appears, drag the DoxyGen application to your applications folder (in the menu on the left).
