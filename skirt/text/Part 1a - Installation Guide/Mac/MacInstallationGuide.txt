This section explains how to install and configure the complete development environment for <tt>SKIRT</tt> on
Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) including the capability to generate HTML and PDF documentation for <tt>SKIRT</tt>.
Mac OS X is written on top of a Unix system (\em not Linux) customized by Apple. This means that most of the standard
Unix tools are available, but things are sufficiently different to warrant a separate treatment.

Some of the installation steps described below require you to enter Unix shell commands in a Terminal window.
In most cases, you will need to be or become super-user (for example using \c sudo \c bash) for the commands
to run successfully.

If you only want to install <tt>SKIRT</tt> for your radiative transfer problems without adding modifications to the source code, read through sections:

- \subpage InstallMacComp
- \subpage InstallMacQt
- \subpage InstallMacGet
- \subpage InstallMacBuildNoQtCreator
- \subpage InstallMacVerify

For setting <tt>SKIRT</tt> up for development and building, follow the instructions in:

- \subpage InstallMacComp 
- \subpage InstallMacQt
- \subpage InstallMacGetDevelop
- \subpage InstallMacConfigQt 
- \subpage InstallMacBuildQtCreator
