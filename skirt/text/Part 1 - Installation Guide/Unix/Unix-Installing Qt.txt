\page InstallSrcQt Installing the Qt tools and libraries

<tt>SKIRT</tt> uses the Qt application framework, so the Qt libraries and build tools should be installed on your computer
before attempting to compile or build <tt>SKIRT</tt> (even if you don't use the full Qt development environment). To do this,
follow the instructions below.

<i>Step-by-step instructions:</i>

<b>Download the Qt source code</b>

- Go to the <a href="http://download.qt-project.org/archive/qt/">Qt download page</a>. You see different folders corresponding with
  different Qt releases. <tt>SKIRT</tt> has been tested with version 5.2.1 and 5.3.2 (on Ubuntu). 
- On the webpage, navigate to either the subdirectory corresponding to the latest relaease (or another release if desired). Then, open the directory called "single".
- Download the package called "qt-everywhere-opensource-src-x.x.x.tar.gz", corresponding with the appropriate version number. If you are working
  on a server, you can copy the link to this package and type the following command in a Terminal window:
  
      wget [PASTE] [ENTER]

  Where <tt>[PASTE]</tt> is to be replaced with the link you copied to your clipboard. This command will download the package to whatever directory you had currently open
  in Terminal.

<b>Modify the build script</b>

The <tt>SKIRT</tt> source code includes a shell script \c makeQt_everywhere.sh (located in the \c SKIRT/git directory) to assist 
with building Qt from source. To minimize dependencies on external libraries, the provided script builds only a limited Qt 
subset that is sufficient for the current version of <tt>SKIRT</tt>. You can use the script as is, but more likely you will need to 
modify it to suit your needs in the following ways:

 - Adjust the value of the \c -prefix option to specify the directory where the Qt libraries will be installed;
 - Add a \c -platform option with a value that specifies the appropriate compiler and operating system,
   unless you know that the default will work for your environment; the value of the platform option must be
   the name of one of the subdirectories in the \c mkspecs directory inside the Qt source distribution.

\note On the servers used by the Ghent University <tt>SKIRT</tt> team, the default platform works fine so you can omit the
\c -platform option.

\note On the Ghent University High Performance Computing (HPC) system, Qt has already been installed (version 5.2.1) and provided as a module. Load "Qt/5.2.1-intel-2015a" to build SKIRT.

<b>Run the script</b>

After editing the script as needed, enter the following shell commands (but replace x.x.x. by the appropriate version number) to build Qt from source (it takes a while!):

    cd <directory-containing-qt-source-distribution>
    tar xvfz qt-everywhere-opensource-src-x.x.x.tar.gz
    cd qt-everywhere-opensource-src-x.x.x
    cp ~/SKIRT/git/makeQt_everywhere.sh .
    chmod +rx makeQt_everywhere.sh
    ./makeQt_everywhere.sh
