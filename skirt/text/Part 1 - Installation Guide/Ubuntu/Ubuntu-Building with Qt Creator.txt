\page InstallUbuntuBuildQtCreator Building SKIRT with Qt Creator

<i>Step-by-step instructions:</i>

<b>Open the SKIRT project file</b>

- Open Qt Creator.
- Choose the menu item "File->Open File or Project...".
- Locate the Qt project file \c BuildSKIRT.pro inside your \c SKIRT/git directory.
- Press the "Open" button from within the dialog.

Qt Creator now opens a configuration pane for the BuildSKIRT project in its main window (see the screenshot below). Simply press the
"Configure Project..." button without changing any of the values, which causes Qt Creator to switch to
regular "Edit" mode. However you still need to adjust the project configuration.

<b>Configure the SKIRT project</b>

- Select "Projects" mode in the left margin of the Qt Creator window and select the "Build & Run" tab. 
- There should be two subtabs called "Build" and "Run", placed under a "Desktop" header stating your Qt and compiler version. 
- First, select the "Build" subtab. There are two build configurations called "Debug" and "Release", 
  which can be selected through the "Edit build configuration" option list.
- For the "Debug" configuration, change the "Build directory" to the \c SKIRT/debug directory you created earlier
  (simply replace the capitcal 'D' by a lower-case 'd').
- For the "Release" configuration, change the "Build directory" to the \c SKIRT/release directory you created earlier 
  (simply replace the capital 'R' by a lower-case 'r').
- There is also a "Profile" configuration, but you can ignore this (unless you know what profiling is and you plan on using it during SKIRT development. In that case, make a directory next to the 'release' and 'debug' directories and set the corresponding build directory in the Profile configuration pane).
- Still in "Projects" mode, now select the "Run" subtab. 
- Search for the option list called "Run configuration" and select the "SKIRTmain" item. 
- Now change the "Working directory" to the \c SKIRT/run directory you created earlier. 
- Turn off the "Run in terminal" option;
  this causes <tt>SKIRT</tt>'s log messages to appear inside Qt Creator rather than in a separate Terminal window.
- Finally go back to "Edit" mode (icon in left margin). Here you can browse, view and edit the source tree (see screenshot below).

\note By default, <tt>SKIRT</tt> will be built without its graphical component <tt>SKIRT MakeUp</tt> and with MPI enabled (if present on the system). To change
these settings, see \ref ChangingBuildOptions.

<b>Build SKIRT</b>

To compile and build the complete <tt>SKIRT</tt> code (including <tt>FitSKIRT</tt>), click the hammer icon in the left margin, indicated
in the screenshot below.
