<i> Step-by-step instructions: </i>

<b> Add the <tt>SKIRT</tt> release directory to your path. </b>

  - In Terminal, type:

        cd [ENTER]
        gedit ~/.bashrc [ENTER]

    This will open the .bashrc file in a text editor window.

  - Add the following line to the end of your .bashrc:

        export PATH=~/SKIRT/release/SKIRTmain:~/SKIRT/release/FitSKIRTmain:$PATH

    Apart from possible other user-defined lines, your .bashrc should now look as follows:

    \image html skirtPATHUbuntu.png
    \image latex skirtPATHUbuntu.png

  - Next, save the file.

<b> Testing everything out. </b>

  - Close any open Terminal window.
  - Launch a new Terminal window.
  - Type:

        skirt [ENTER]
	
  - If you see the following messages:

    \image html skirtinteractiveUbuntu.jpeg
	\image latex skirtinteractiveUbuntu.jpeg

    your <tt>SKIRT</tt> installation has succeeded. You can either follow the instructions in the Terminal window to create a ski (skirt simulation) file or press [CTRL] + C to exit the program. 
   
  - To get information about how you can use SKIRT, you can type 'skirt -h', which will yield the following output:
   
   \image html skirthelpUbuntu.jpeg
   \image latex skirthelpUbuntu.jpeg

  - You can also proceed with the \ref UsersGuide.
