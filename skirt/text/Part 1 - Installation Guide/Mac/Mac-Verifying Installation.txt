<i> Step-by-step instructions: </i>

<b> Add the <tt>SKIRT</tt> release directory to your path. </b>

  - In Terminal, type:

        cd [ENTER]
        open ~/.profile [ENTER]

    The corresponding file will open in your default text editor.
    
  - Add the following line to your .profile file:

        export PATH=~/SKIRT/release/SKIRTmain:~/SKIRT/release/FitSKIRTmain:$PATH

  - Next, save the file.

\note On Mac, the .profile script is not loaded when you also have a .bash_profile file in your home directory. In that case, the procedure described
above will not work. To resolve this, you have two options: either you place the above line also in your .bash_profile file (which will still cause other
commands in .profile to be ignored), or you add the following line to your .bash_profile: <tt>source ~/.profile</tt>. By doing this, when the system
loads .bash_profile, the .profile is automatically loaded too.

<b> Testing everything out. </b>

  - Close any open Terminal window.
  - Launch a new Terminal window.
  - Type:

        skirt [ENTER]
	
  - If you see the following messages:

    \image html skirtinteractive.jpeg
	\image latex skirtinteractive.jpeg

    your <tt>SKIRT</tt> installation has succeeded. You can either follow the instructions in the Terminal window to create a ski (skirt simulation) file or press [CTRL] + C to exit the program. 
   
  - To get information about how you can use SKIRT, you can type 'skirt -h', which will yield the following output:
   
   \image html skirthelp.jpeg
   \image latex skirthelp.jpeg

  - You can also proceed with the \ref UsersGuide.
