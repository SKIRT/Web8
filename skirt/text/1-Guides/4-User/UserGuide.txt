\note The text in this chapter assumes that you have installed the <tt>SKIRT</tt> project on your computer as explained
in the \ref InstallationGuide.

\section UserSKIRT SKIRT user guide

The best way to begin using \c SKIRT is to run through the tutorials offered in the
<a href="../tutorials/index.html">Tutorials</a> section on this web site, and then to turn back to this user guide for
additional reference information and guidance. Also, detailed information on a specific <tt>SKIRT</tt> option and its
effect can be found in the documentation for the C++ class implementing the option. As explained in
\ref UserSkirtParamEdit, the relevant class name (and hence the corresponding documentation) is fairly easy to locate
even for a non-developer.

The \c SKIRT user guide includes the following topics:

- <a href="../tutorials/index.html">Tutorials</a>
- \subpage UserSkirtCmdLine
- \subpage UserSkirtParamFile
- \subpage UserSkirtMPI


\section UserFitSKIRT FitSKIRT user guide

Again, the best way to begin using \c FitSKIRT is to run through the corresponding tutorials offered in the
<a href="../tutorials/index.html">Tutorials</a> section on this web site. These tutorials explain
how to bring observed data into an appropriate format for fitting with FitSKIRT, and how to set the FitSKIRT
parameters accordingly.

This user guide offers further guidance on how to setup and use the FitSKIRT program. It includes the following topics:

- <a href="../tutorials/index.html">Tutorials</a>

\section UserMakeUp MakeUp user guide

\c MakeUp is an optional component of the \c SKIRT project that requires installation of the Qt libraries. Assuming you

interface:
