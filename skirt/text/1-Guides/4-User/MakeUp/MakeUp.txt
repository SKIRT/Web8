\section UserMakeUpIntro Introduction

As mentioned in the \ref ProjectOverview, the \c SKIRT project includes an optional utility called \c MakeUp.
If the \c MakeUp utility has been built (see the \ref InstallationGuide), a \c SKIRT or \c FitSKIRT
parameter file can be created or edited using the graphical wizard-like interface offered by this utility.

The <tt>MakeUp</tt> utility is built as a separate program, so it does not need to run on the same computer as the
<tt>SKIRT</tt> and <tt>FitSKIRT</tt> programs. The consecutive wizard panes follow the same pattern as the Q&A session
driven by the command-line programs, with important benefits offered by the graphical user interface:

- You have the possibility of modifying existing \em ski or \em fski files, without having to open them in a text
  editor and manually changing values. Sometimes changing a certain parameter requires other additional parameters to
  be set or others to be deleted from the parameter file, which is not easily done by hand. The <tt>MakeUp</tt>
  interface will automatically adapt its questions after you change such a parameter.
- With <tt>MakeUp</tt>, you can go back to the preceding wizard panes. With the command line Q&A session, when you
  enter an incorrect value, you either have to abort the session and start over, or you have to remember to change the
  value once the parameter file had been created. And when you select a parameter value that influences the course of
  the session (e.g. you add the wrong type of geometry), you have no other choice than to start over.
- When adding components to a list (instruments, geometries, stellar or dust components), you get a visualization of
  the components already added. You also have the option to edit any component in the list, or to remove one.
- <tt>MakeUp</tt> provides context-sensitive help on the items and properties being configured through built-in links
  to the \c SKIRT web site.

Once the \c SKIRT project has been built with the appropriate build options (see the \ref InstallationGuide), the
executable for <tt>MakeUp</tt> can be found in a directory called <tt>~/SKIRT/release/MakeUp/main</tt>. On some
platforms, such as Mac OS X, you can double-click the application icon to launch \c MakeUp. On other platforms, it has
to be launched from the command line (but there are no command line options).

When \c MakeUp is launched, the following window appears:

In this window, <tt>MakeUp</tt> offers the possibility of creating new parameters files for both <tt>SKIRT</tt> and
<tt>FitSKIRT</tt> and of editing existing ones. Selecting one of the different options and pressing "Continue" will
bring you into a wizard session that follows the same pattern as the command line interface invoked by typing
<tt>skirt</tt> or <tt>fitskirt</tt> in a Terminal window. For example, while adding a exponential disk as a stellar
component, the wizard pane may look like this:

In the configuration pane for a particular property, there are two noteworthy user-assistance features:

- When you right-click on the text describing a property or option, \c MakeUp displays a context-sensitive popup menu
  with a list of help options. Selecting one of these options opens the corresponding online \c SKIRT documentation
  in your default web browser.
- The lower left corner of the <tt>MakeUp</tt> window shows the name and "path" of the property being configured
  as it would appear in a \em ski file. This can help an advanced user locate the property in ski files
  for manual editing.

At the end of the session, a final wizard pane asks the user to save the new or adjusted configuration in a
parameter file on disk.
