\page InstallMPI Enable multiprocessing (Mac/Unix)

\note The \c SKIRT and \c FitSKIRT command line programs support multi-threading within a single process without the
need for any external dependencies other than the C++ compiler. The information below is relevant only if you want to
run multiple parallel processes, possibly on multiple compute nodes. See also the concept note on \ref Parallelization.

To enable the multi-processing capabilities of the \c SKIRT and/or \c FitSKIRT command line programs, the host
operating system must provide an implementation of the standard Message Passing Interface (MPI), and the \c SKIRT
project must be (re)built with the corresponding build option enabled.

This topic contains the following sections:
- \ref InstallMPIInstall
- \ref InstallMPIEnable


\section InstallMPIInstall Install an MPI implementation

\subsection InstallMPIInstallVersion MPI Version

The \c SKIRT project requires an MPI implementation that supports standard MPI v2.1 or later.

\subsection InstallMPIInstallModule Systems using modules

Large multi-node computing systems will have one or more MPI implementations installed by the system administrator. Use
the "module" system to load the MPI implementation and version that matches the compiler used for building the \c SKIRT
project. For example:

\verbatim
module load cmake/3.7.0
module load intel_comp/c5/2017
module load platform_mpi/9.1.2
\endverbatim

\subsection InstallMPIInstallMac Mac OS X

For testing purposes, it might be useful to run \c SKIRT or \c FitSKIRT in multi-processing mode on a laptop or desktop
computer. \c OpenMPI (not to be confused with \c OpenMP) is a freely available MPI implementation that is a good choice
in this case. Follow the instructions below to install \c OpenMPI.

<b> Download the source code </b>

- Navigate to the  <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/software/">OpenMPI webpage</a>.
- Download the 'tar.gz' file for the latest stable version.
- When the download has finished, click on the resulting 'tar' file and it should automatically be unpacked.

<b> Compile and install the source code </b>

- Open a Terminal window and navigate to the newly created folder (replace x.x.x with the appropriate version number)
with the command:

      cd ~/Downloads/openmpi-x.x.x

- Then, enter:

      ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

- You will see lots of output. If this procedure has finished, enter:

      make all

- Again, many lines of output will appear. Finally, enter:

      sudo make install

  If you are prompted for your password, enter it.

- After again lots of output, check the installation by executing the following commands:

      which mpicxx [ENTER]
      which mpirun [ENTER]

- If either of these commands does NOT show any output, something is wrong.

\subsection InstallMPIInstallOther Other Unix systems including Ubuntu

\c OpenMPI (not to be confused with \c OpenMP) is a freely available MPI implementation that is a good choice for
supporting multi-processing on small networks, standalone servers and even desktop computers (although the latter is
usually less meaningful). Follow the instructions below to install \c OpenMPI on Ubuntu; the procedure for other Unix
systems is likely very similar.

<b> Download the source code </b>

- Navigate to the  <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/software/">OpenMPI webpage</a>.
- Download the 'tar.gz' file for the latest stable version to your Downloads folder.

<b> Compile and install the source code </b>

- Open a Terminal window and unpack the newly downloaded file by entering the following commands (replace x.x.x. with
  the appropriate version number):

      cd ~/Downloads
      tar xvfz openmpi-x.x.x.tar.gz

  This will produce lots of output.

- Then, enter:

      cd openmpi-x.x.x
      ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

- You will see lots of output. After this procedure has finished, enter:

      make all

- Again, many lines of output will appear. Finally, enter:

      sudo make install

  If you are prompted for your password, enter it.

- After again lots of output, check the installation by executing the following commands:

      which mpicxx
      which mpirun

- If either of these commands does NOT show any output, something is wrong.

<b> Create the necessary links to the OpenMPI library </b>

- In a terminal window, enter the following:

      sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib

  If you are prompted for your password, enter it.


\section InstallMPIEnable Enable the MPI build option

Once you have verified that the host system provides an MPI implementation, you need to enable the \c BUILD_WITH_MPI
build option and rebuild the \c SKIRT project:

- For information about build options, see \ref InstallOptions.
- For instructions on how to configure build options, see one of:
   - \ref InstallUnixBuild;
   - \ref InstallQtBuild.
