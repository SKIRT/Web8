\page InstallFFT Enable fast-fourier-transform for FitSKIRT (Mac/Unix)

If the reference images provided to \c FitSKIRT use point-spread functions with a customized form (as opposed to
Gaussian), it is recommended to install a third-party fast-fourier transform (FFT) libary to accelerate the convolution
calculations for the simulated images.

This topic contains the following sections:
- \ref InstallFFTInstall
- \ref InstallFFTEnable

\section InstallFFTInstall Install the FFT library

XXX-TODO


\section InstallFFTEnable Enable the FFT build option

Once you have verified that FFT library is properly installed, you need to enable the \c BUILD_WITH_FFT build option
and rebuild the \c SKIRT project:

- For information about build options, see \ref InstallOptions.
- For instructions on how to configure build options, see one of:
   - \ref InstallUnixBuild;
   - \ref InstallQtBuild.
