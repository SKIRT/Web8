\page InstallFFT Enable fast-fourier-transform for FitSKIRT (Mac/Unix)

If the reference images provided to \c FitSKIRT use point-spread functions with a customized form (as opposed to
Gaussian), it is recommended to install a third-party fast-fourier transform (FFT) libary to accelerate the convolution
calculations for the simulated images.

This topic contains the following sections:
- \ref InstallFFTInstall
- \ref InstallFFTEnable

\section InstallFFTInstall Install the FFT library

\c FitSKIRT can work with the open-source "FFTW" library available from the www.fftw.org web site. To install this
library, go to the <a href="http://www.fftw.org/download.html">FFTW download page</a>. Check the platform-specific
notes on the download page, and download the source code tarball for the latest stable release. After unpacking the
tarball, follow the instructions in the \c README file to compile and install the library on your system.

\section InstallFFTEnable Enable the FFT build option

Once you have verified that FFT library is properly installed, you need to enable the \c BUILD_WITH_FFT build option
and rebuild the \c SKIRT project:

- For information about build options, see \ref InstallOptions.
- For instructions on how to configure build options, see one of:
   - \ref InstallUnixBuild;
   - \ref InstallQtBuild.
