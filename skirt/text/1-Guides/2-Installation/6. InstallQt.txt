\page InstallQt Use Qt Creator to build MakeUp (all platforms)

You may wish to install the Qt development environment (although the \c SKIRT and \c FitSKIRT command line programs do
not depend on it), so that you can use the graphical user interface offered by the optional \c MakeUp utility for
configuring parameter files. Apart from this, Qt Creator is an excellent C++ source code editor and build environment.
So you can just as well use it to configure and build the \c SKIRT project.

This topic contains the following sections:
- \ref InstallQtToolsGet
- \ref InstallQtInstall
- \ref InstallQtBuild
- \ref InstallQtFinal


\section InstallQtToolsGet Install the build tools and get the source code (Qt Creator)

As a first step, you need to install the basic build tools (\c git, \c CMake, and C++ compiler) and obtain a local copy
of the \c SKIRT project source code, just like you would if you were not using Qt. Follow the instructions appropriate
for your operating system:
- \ref InstallUnixTools
- \ref InstallUnixGet
- \ref InstallWindowsTools
- \ref InstallWindowsGet

There is no need to configure and build the \c SKIRT project according to the platform-specific instructions, because
that will be accomplished with Qt Creator as described below.


\section InstallQtInstall Install the Qt development environment

The \c SKIRT project requires Qt Desktop v5.7.0. or later.

In addition to cross-platform run-time libraries, the Qt development environment includes a convenient integrated code
editor/builder called Qt Creator. All of these components can be installed with a single installer.

<b> Download the installer </b>

  - Go to the <a href="http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/">Qt download page</a>.
  - If the web site properly identified your operating system, press "Download Now" and wait for the installer
    to be downloaded.
  - Otherwise, press "View All Downloads" and download an installer appropriate for your system. Select an
    online installer unless you have a good reason to use an offline installer.

<b> Open the installer </b>

  - Launch the installer you just downloaded. The precise procedure will differ depending on your operating system:
    - On Mac OS X, double click the downloaded disk image file ('.dmg") to mount the disk, and then
      double-click the installer in the newly opened window. You will get a warning that the program was downloaded
      from the internet, but you can click 'Open' anyway since this source can be trusted.
    - On Windows, respond "yes" when your browser asks whether
      to actually execute the downloaded executable file, or simply double click the file.
    - On Linux, you need to make the downloaded file executable and then launch it from the command line, e.g.:

          cd Downloads
          chmod +rx qt-unified-linux-x64-online.run
          ./qt-unified-linux-x64-online.run

<b> Select the components to be installed </b>

  - Follow the on-screen instructions to initiate the installation. You can skip creating a Qt Account unless you want
    to. You will also be asked to choose the installation folder for Qt; it is best to keep this at the default value.

  - When you enter the "Select Components" screen, unfold the item that is marked as the Qt version to be installed.
    In the list that appears, uncheck all items except "macOS".

  - Press continue and follow the subsequent steps until the actual installation starts.

<b> Make a shortcut to Qt Creator </b>

  - At the end of the installation, you can choose to open Qt Creator. This gives you an opportunity for creating a
    permanent shortcut to Qt Creator in your dock or task bar. Right-click the application icon in the dock or task bar
    and select "Lock" in the popup menu (or equivalent operation depending on your operating system).

  - Alternatively, locate the Qt Creator application in the newly installed directory, and drag the application icon to
    your dock or task bar (or equivalent operation depending on your operating system).

<b> Configure the build tools in Qt Creator </b>

  - Open Qt Creator if needed.

  - Show the Qt Creator preferences panel (depending on your operating system, choose the menu item
    "Qt Creator -> Preferences..." or "Tools->Options...").

  - Select the "Build&Run->CMake" tab and verify that Qt automatically detected the correct version of CMake installed
    on your computer. If not, manually add it to the list. <b>Important note for Mac OS X</b>: configure the command
    line version of cmake that resides \em inside the <b>CMake.app</b> directory, i.e.
    <tt>/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake</tt>, rather than the <tt>CMake.app</tt> GUI application itself.

  - Select the "Build&Run->Compilers" tab and verify that Qt automatically detected the compilers installed on your
    computer. If not, manually add a suitable C and C++ compiler.

  - Select the "Build&Run->Qt Versions" tab and verify that Qt automatically detected the Qt version you just installed.
    If not, manually add an appropriate Qt version.

  - Select the "Build&Run->Kits" tab. Usually there is only a single kit called "Desktop xxxx (Default)". If there are
    muliple kits, verify that the appropriate kit is marked as "Default". Verify and if needed configure the properties
    of the default kit, specifically "Compiler", "Qt version" and "CMake Tool". The "CMake Generator" property should
    be set to "Code Blocks - Unix Makefiles ..."

  - Press "OK" to accept any changes and close the preferences panel.

<b> Install system libraries if required </b>

On some Unix systems other than Mac OS X, the Qt libraries used by the optional \c MakeUp tool in the \c SKIRT project
depend on extra system libraries. On Ubuntu these libraries can be installed as follows:

    sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev


\section InstallQtBuild Configure and build the project (Qt Creator)

\subsection InstallQtBuildFirst Building for the first time

<b>Open the SKIRT project file</b>

- Open Qt Creator.
- Choose the menu item "File->Open File or Project...".
- From within the dialog, locate and select the file \c CMakeLists.txt in your \c SKIRT/git directory
  (at the top level, \em not in one of the subdirectories).
- Press the "Open" button in the dialog.

Qt Creator now opens a configuration pane for the \c SKIRT project in its main window. Simply press the
"Configure Project..." button without changing any of the values, which causes Qt Creator to switch to
regular "Edit" mode. However you still need to adjust the project configuration.

<b>Configure the SKIRT project</b>

- Select "Projects" mode in the left margin of the Qt Creator window.
- Select the "Build" item in the lefthand column of the window, just below a "Desktop" header stating your
  Qt and compiler version.
- In the "Edit build configuration" option list at the top of the window, select "Release".
- Change the "Build directory" to the \c ~/SKIRT/release directory you created earlier (i.e. change the last segment
  of the path from "build-git-...-Release" to "release", or press "Choose..." to browse to the directory).
- Verify that the "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE" setting has the value "Release" (if not, you may have negelected to select the
  Release" build configuration in the option list at the top of the window).
- For now, leave the build options to their default values.

Your window should now look similar to this:

\image html InstallQtProjectSettings.png

<b>Build the SKIRT project</b>

- Select "Edit" mode in the left margin of the Qt Creator window.
  In this mode, you can browse, view and edit the source tree of the project.
- Click the hammer icon in the lower left corner of the Qt Creator window to compile and build the \c SKIRT project
  with the current build options. To view the build log, select the "Compile Output" tab at the bottom of the
  Qt Creator window.

Your window should now look similar to this:

\image html InstallQtEditBuild.png

\subsection InstallQtBuildOptions Adjusting build options

XXX-TODO
  - configure build options

If you have Qt Creator installed, there is no need to
work directly with CMake. Recent versions of Qt Creator have great built-in support for CMake.


\section InstallQtFinal Finalize the installation (Qt Creator)

As the last step, you need to finalize and verify your installation just like you would if you were not using Qt.
Follow the instructions appropriate for your operating system:
  - \ref InstallUnixFinal
  - \ref InstallWindowsFinal
