\page InstallSrcPacks Installing development tools

<tt>SKIRT</tt> is written in C++11, the C++ flavor that was standardized in 2011, extending the language with new features.
The <tt>SKIRT</tt> source code resides in an online GitHub repository, which you can access from your computer
through the \c git client. Hence you need to install a recent C++ compiler and the \c git client. If you plan to use the MPI
capabilities of <tt>SKIRT</tt> and/or <tt>FitSKIRT</tt>, you also need an MPI implementation installed on the system (<tt>SKIRT</tt> is
tested with OpenMPI).

Depending on the particular Unix flavor under consideration, you may accomplish this by any of the following means:

 - Use a standard package manager for your system;
 - Download and run an installer that was downloaded manually;
 - If you don't have the rights to install the tools yourself, ask your system manager to do it.
