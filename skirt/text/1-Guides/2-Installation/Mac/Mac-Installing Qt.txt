\page InstallMacQt Installing the Qt development environment

<tt>SKIRT</tt> is based on the Qt development environment. 
In addition to run-time libraries and build tools, Qt offers
a convenient integrated code editor called Qt Creator. All of these components can be installed on Mac OS X with
a single installer.

<i> Step-by-step instructions: </i>

<b> Download the binaries for OS X </b>

  - Go to the <a href="http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/">Qt download page</a>.
  - Press "Download Now" and wait for the executable to be downloaded.

<b> Open the installer </b>

  - Open the '.dmg' file that you just downloaded to mount the installation disk.
  - When the mounting has finished, the following Finder window will appear:
  
    \image html qtinstaller.png
    \image latex qtinstaller.png
    
  - Double-click on the installer. You will get a warning that the program was downloaded from the internet, but click 'Open' anyway since this source can be trusted.
  
  - Follow the instructions to initiate the installation. You can skip creating a Qt Account unless you want to. You will also be asked to choose the installation folder for Qt, but it is best to keep this at the default value. When you enter the "Select Components" screen, unfold the item that is marked as the Qt version that is to be installed. In the list that appears, uncheck all items except "OS X" (see screenshot)

  - Press continue and follow the subsequent steps. At the end of the installation, you can choose to open Qt Creator, but you don't need to.

<b> Make a shortcut to Qt Creator </b>

  - Use Finder or Spotlight to locate the \em Qt \em Creator application in the newly installed directory,
    and drag the application icon to your dock (or add it to your preferred application launcher).
