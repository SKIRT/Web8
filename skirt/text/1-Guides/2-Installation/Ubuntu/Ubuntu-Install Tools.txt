\page InstallUbuntuPacks Installing development tools on Ubuntu

<tt>SKIRT</tt> is written in C++11, the C++ flavor that was standardized in 2011, extending the language with new features.
The <tt>SKIRT</tt> source code resides in an online GitHub repository, which you can access from your computer
through the \c git client. Hence you need to install a recent C++ compiler and the \c git client.

On Ubuntu you can accomplish this easily by installing the appropriate packages using the standard package manager.
Open a new Terminal window:

\image html ubuntuTerminal.png
\image latex ubuntuTerminal.png

and enter the following commands:

    sudo apt-get install g++ [ENTER]
    sudo apt-get install git [ENTER]

For both procedures, you will be asked for your password and prompted with the following message:

    Do you want to continue? [Y/n]

Provide your password and type <tt>Y [ENTER]</tt> where needed.
