\page InstallWindows Basic install using graphical interfaces (Windows)

This topic describes how to install and configure the \c SKIRT project on Microsoft Windows, using the
graphical user interfaces offered by the various tools involved. Note that you still need the command line
to actually run the \c SKIRT and \c FitSKIRT command line programs.

This topic contains the following sections:
- \ref InstallWindowsTools
- \ref InstallWindowsGet
- \ref InstallWindowsBuild
- \ref InstallWindowsFinal


\section InstallWindowsTools Install the build tools (Windows)

The \c SKIRT project has been tested with CMake v3.5.1 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 v14 running on Windows 10.
Earlier versions of these tools and operating system may not support all the required capabilities. In general, later
versions should work fine.

- Download the latest version of the freely available Microsoft Visual Studio Community edition
  from https://www.visualstudio.com and launch the installer.

- Select a custom install to include Visual C++ and the git and GitHub GUI clients.

- Download the latest version of CMake for Windows from https://cmake.org/download/ and perform the installation.


\section InstallWindowsGet Get the source code (Windows)

To get the \c SKIRT project source code:

- Launch the GitHub GUI client and login to your github.com account (to access the public repository) and/or your
  "enterprise" account at github.ugent.be (to access the private repository).

- Clone the \c SKIRT project source code from the corresponding online repository into a local \c ~/SKIRT/git directory.


\section InstallWindowsBuild Configure and build the project (Windows)

To build the \c SKIRT project for the first time:

- Launch the CMake GUI application.
- Set the source path to the repository (e.g. \c ~/SKIRT/git).
- Set the build path to a new directory next to the repository (e.g. \c ~/SKIRT/build).
- Select the generator "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" (assuming you have version 14 of Visual Studio).
- Press "Configure" and then "Generate" to generate a Visual Studio solution.
- Launch Visual Studio and open the solution file generated in the previous step (filename extension ".sln").
- Press the "Build Solution" button to build the \c SKIRT project with the current build options.

To adjust build options (see \ref InstallOptions for a list of options):

- Launch the CMake GUI application and set build path if needed (e.g. \c ~/SKIRT/build).
- Use the checkboxes and text fields in the central panel to adjust one or more values in the list.
- Press the "Configure" button at the bottom of the list to integrate the changes into the configuration
  and update the list of variables accordingly. In some cases, you need to repeat this process.
- Press the "Generate" button to update the Visual Studio solution.
- In Visual Studio, press the "Build Solution" button to rebuild the \c SKIRT project with the new build options.


\section InstallWindowsFinal Finalize the installation (Windows)

To verify your installation of the \c SKIRT project:

- Launch a command line window and change the current directory to your working directory (e.g. \c ~/SKIRT/run).
- Enter the command "..\build\.....\skirt.exe" without any command-line arguments.
  If the \c SKIRT project has been successfully installed, you should see the \c SKIRT welcome message.
