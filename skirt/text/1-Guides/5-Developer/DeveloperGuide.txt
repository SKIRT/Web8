\page DeveloperGuide Developer Guide

This guide offers guidelines on how to extend or adjust the code in the <tt>SKIRT</tt> project.

The <tt>SKIRT</tt> proje3ct code will never be finished. Fundamental changes and additions will probably be developed
by the core <tt>SKIRT</tt> team at the Ghent University. Other changes, such as introducing a new spectral energy
distribution for the sources or a new function describing the geometrical distribution of the dust, can easily be
contributed by any <tt>SKIRT</tt> user. In fact, when you plan to use <tt>SKIRT</tt> for a particular
radiative transfer problem, chances are that you will want to adapt or extend it to suit your needs.

You should start learning about <tt>SKIRT</tt> development by performing the development-related tutorials offered
as part of the <a href="../tutorials/index.html">Tutorials</a> section on this web site.

This developer guide includes the following topics with further guidance and reference material:
