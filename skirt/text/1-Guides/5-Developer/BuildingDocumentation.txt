\section DevBuildRefDocs Reference documentation

The reference documentation for the \c SKIRT project is generated from the C++ header files using the freely available
utility Doxygen. For information on how to install this utility, refer to \ref InstallMacDoxygen.

When you add or adjust code, it is important to provide proper documentation in the header file, in Doxygen format. To
verify that everything looks as intended, especially when including formulas in mathematical notation, you should build
the HTML documentation and open the resulting page(s) in a web browser.

The \c git project directory contains a shell script for building the documentation. The script is designed for use on
Mac OS X and will need to be adjusted for use on other systems. For example, the absolute path to the Doxygen
executable will need to be updated, and the html.doxygen parameter file may need some tweaking as well.

Before invoking the script for the first time, you may need to make it executable as follows:

\verbatim
cd ~/SKIRT/git
chmod +rx makeHTML.sh
\endverbatim

To build the HTML reference documentation, enter:

\verbatim
cd ~/SKIRT/git
./makeHTML.sh
\endverbatim

The resulting HTML files are placed in the \c html directory next to (i.e. at the same level as) the \c git directory.
As usual, the file \c index.html provides the starting point for browsing.

When you run the script for the first time, Doxygen creates the \c html directory and it contents from scratch. This
takes a long time. If you run the script again after you modified the source code (or the extra documentation files),
Doxygen only processes the changes so it completes a lot faster.

\section DevBuildExtraDocs Additional documentation

The source files for the additional documentation on the \c SKIRT web site, including the tutorials and the
installation, user and developer guides, are not part of the \c SKIRT project source tree. This documentation is
maintained, built and published by the core \c SKIRT team.
