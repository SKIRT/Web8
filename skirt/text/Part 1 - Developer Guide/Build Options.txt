\page ChangingBuildOptions Changing the build options

The <tt>SKIRT</tt> build procedure can be configured by modifying a single text file included in the <tt>SKIRT</tt> source tree. 
This file is called "BuildOptions.pri" and can be found in two different ways:

- Either by navigating to the directory "BuildUtils" inside \c SKIRT/git (in a Terminal window or in your file browser);
- or by opening the file in Qt Creator by clicking on "BuildOptions" in the tree structure on the left of the screen (see screenshot).

The "BuildOptions.pri" file contains two configurable lines:

- The first line determines whether the graphical component of <tt>SKIRT</tt>, <tt>SKIRT MakeUp</tt>, should be built or not. On Mac,
  this option is enabled by default, wheras on Unix systems <tt>SKIRT MakeUp</tt> will not be compiled by default. To enable it on these systems,
  remove the "macx:" prefix from the line. To disable buildling <tt>SKIRT MakeUp</tt> on Mac, precede the entire line by the "#" character. 
- On the second line, you can specify whether <tt>SKIRT</tt> (and <tt>FitSKIRT</tt>) should be built with MPI or not. By default, MPI is enabled,
  allowing you to start simulations or fit schemes with the \c mpirun command. If MPI is not installed on the system, this option will be ignored.
  To disable building with MPI, in the case an MPI distribution is indeed installed on your system, precede the second configuration line with a 
  "#" character.
