\page DevelopersGuide Developer Guide

This guide offers guidelines on how to extend or adjust the SKIRT code.

The <tt>SKIRT</tt> code will never be finished. Fundamental changes and additions will probably be developed by the core
<tt>SKIRT</tt> team at the Ghent University. Other changes, such as introducing a new spectral energy distribution for the sources or a new function
describing the geometrical distribution of the dust, can easily be contributed by any heavy-duty <tt>SKIRT</tt> user.
In fact, when you plan to use <tt>SKIRT</tt> for a particular radiative transfer problem, chances are that you will
want to adapt or extend it to suit your needs.

This guide consists of multiple topics:

- \ref DevDirs
- \ref DevBuildDocs
- \ref DevStyle
- \ref DevCodeStruct
- \ref DevDiscoUsage
- \ref DevGit
- \ref ChangingBuildOptions
- \ref DevTut
