/**

\page DevDirs Directory Structure

The SKIRT source code is contained in an online repository and can be obtained as described in \ref InstallationGuide.
The files are organized in a directory structure; your local copy may look as follows:

\verbatim
~/SKIRT
    debug
    git
        Cfitsio
        dat
        Discover
        doc
        ...
    release
        Cfitsio
        Discover
        ...
    run
\endverbatim

The \c git directory contains an identical copy of the online SKIRT repository; it is usually placed inside a local
directory called \c SKIRT in your home directory. The \c debug and \c release directories contain the result of
building the SKIRT project, including the final binary executables. Always use the \c release build for
"production" simulations; the code in the \c debug build is not optimized and runs several times slower.
The \c run directory may contain input/output files involved in actually running SKIRT.
The information in these last three directories obviously does not belong
in the source code repository, which is why these directories are \em not inside the \c git directory.

The \c git directory contains three types of information:
  - Immediately inside the \c git directory reside the main project file \c BuildSKIRT.pro and some
    shell scripts used for installing and building SKIRT or its documentation. For more information,
    see \ref InstallMac, \ref InstallSrcBuild, \ref InstallSrcQt, and \ref DevBuildDocs.
  - Directories with short all-lower-case names contain support files, such as resource files read by the code
    at run time (\c dat), extra documentation that doesn't fit inside the source files (\c doc), and Mathematica
    notebooks for some of the geometry calculations (\c math).
  - Directories with mixed-case names contain the source code; each directory contains the sources for
    a particular subproject, including the \c .pro project file, the \c .hpp header files and the
    \c .cpp source files themselves. For more information, see \ref DevCodeStruct.
