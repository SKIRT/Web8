In this tutorial you will use <tt>SKIRT</tt> to produce a spectral energy distribution (%SED) spanning multiple wavelength bands
for a model imported from the output of a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) simulation.

\section UserTut2Pre Getting ready

Before starting this tutorial, you should have installed and/or built the <tt>SKIRT</tt> code as described in the
\ref InstallationGuide, \em and you should have completed the previous tutorial \ref UserTut1.
A lot of information provided in the previous tutorial is not repeated here!

To complete this tutorial, you need SPH output data that is converted to a format appropriate for importing in SKIRT.
You need a file with stellar particle data and one with gas particle data. The required file formats are described
in the documentation for the functions SPHStellarComp::setFilename() and SPHDustDistribution::setFilename().

Download the files \c eagle_stars.dat and \c eagle_gas.dat from the <a href="http://www.skirt.ugent.be/downloads">SKIRT downloads page</a>
and put them into your \c ~/SKIRT/run directory.

\section UserTut2Ski Creating the ski file

In a Terminal window, with an appropriate current directory, start <tt>SKIRT</tt> without any command line arguments.
SKIRT responds with a welcome message and starts an interactive session in the terminal window, during which it
will prompt you for all the information describing a particular simulation:

\verbatim
   Welcome to SKIRT v___
   Interactively constructing a simulation...
 ? Enter the name of the ski file to be created: PanSPH
\endverbatim

The first question is for the filename of the ski file. For this tutorial, enter "PanSPH".

\section UserTut2Sim Type of simulation

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the simulation:
      1. An oligochromatic Monte Carlo simulation
      2. A panchromatic Monte Carlo simulation
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,2] (1): 2
\endverbatim

In this tutorial the goal is to produce a spectral energy distribution (%SED) including infrared wavelengths
and thus the effects of thermal emission by the dust. By definition this requires a panchromatic simulation.

Leave the parameters related to the random generator and the units system to their default values (not shown).

\section UserTut2Inst Instrument system

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the instrument system:
      1. An instrument system
   Automatically selected the only choice: 1
   Possible choices for item #1 in the instruments list:
      1. A basic instrument that outputs the total integrated flux as an SED

      1. A basic instrument that outputs the total integrated flux as an SED
         ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers or zero to terminate the list [0,6] (3): 0
\endverbatim

For this tutorial, configure at least one instrument of the type that outputs the total integrated flux as an SED.
Specify an inclination and a distance to the system of your liking. You may configure additional instruments,
of the same or of a different type, as you wish.

\verbatim
 ? Enter the number of photon packages per wavelength [1e4,2e13] (1e6): 1e5
\endverbatim

To limit the run time (while at the same time reducing the quality of the results),
set the number of photon packages to \f$10^5\f$.

\section UserTut2Wave Wavelength grid

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the wavelength grid:
      1. A logarithmic wavelength grid
      2. A nested logarithmic wavelength grid
      3. A wavelength grid read from a file
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (1): 1

 ? Enter the longest wavelength [0.0001 micron,1e6 micron]: 1000
 ? Enter the number of wavelength grid points [2,2000000000] (25): 30
\endverbatim

SKIRT currently offers three possibilities: a simple logarithmic grid, a logarithmic grid with a built-in
logarithmic subgrid and a wavelength grid read from a file. Here are some guidelines for an
appropriate choice of the wavelength grid:
 - The coverage of your wavelength grid should be appropriate to the radiative transfer problem.
   Typically radiation is absorbed at UV and optical wavelengths and re-emitted at far-infrared and submillimetre
   wavelengths. So your wavelength grid should typically range from the
   UV to the submm range, i.e. from about 0.1 to 1000 \f$\mu\f$m.
 - On the other hand, don't make your wavelength coverage too large. In order to make a meaningul simulation,
   <tt>SKIRT</tt> must know the spectral properties of the emitters (the stars) and the optical properties of the dust
   at all wavelengths considered. Typically, you should not consider wavelengths shorter than 0.01 \f$\mu\f$m or
   longer than a few mm. If you choose a dust species (see later on) for which the optical properties are not
   defined over the entire specified wavelength range, <tt>SKIRT</tt> will not be able to perform the simulation.
 - You should consider enough grid points to ensure that you have sufficient resolution and precision.
   On the other hand, don't choose a grid that is too fine: the simulation run time is approximately proportional
   to the number of grid points in the wavelength grid. A typical setup uses about 20 grid points for every
   order in wavelength. If you want much more resolution in a certain wavelength range, for example because
   you are studying a spectral region in detail, you can use the nested logarithmic grid.
 - Whatever you decide to do, always make sure that the wavelength grid includes the V band, since the central
   wavelength of the V band is where the optical properties of the dust are normalized. If 550 nm
   is not covered by your wavelength grid, <tt>SKIRT</tt> will terminate.

For this tutorial, select a wavelength grid with 30 grid points distributed logarithmically between 0.1 and 1000
\f$\mu\f$m.

\section UserTut2Stel Stellar system

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the stellar system:
      1. A stellar system
   Automatically selected the only choice: 1
   Possible choices for item #1 in the stellar components list:
      1. A stellar component with a built-in geometry (in an panchromatic simulation)
      2. A stellar component derived from an SPH output file
      3. A stellar component imported from an adaptive mesh data file
      4. A stellar component imported from a Voronoi mesh data file
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,4] (1): 2
 ? Enter the name of the file with the SPH star particles: eagle_stars.dat
 ? Output the luminosities per wavelength bin? [yes/no] (no):
\endverbatim

In this tutorial, the stellar information is imported from the output of an SPH simulation. You need SPH stellar
particle data in a format appropriate for importing in SKIRT, as described in the documentation for the function
SPHStellarComp::setFilename(). Select the appropriate stellar component type and enter the name of your stellar
particle data file.

\section UserTut2Dust Dust system

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the dust system:
      1. A dust system for use with panchromatic simulations
 ? Enter one of these numbers or zero to select none [0,1] (1):
   Possible choices for the dust distribution:
      1. A dust distribution composed of various dust components
      2. A dust distribution derived from an SPH output file
      3. A dust distribution imported from an adaptive mesh data file
      4. A dust distribution imported from a Voronoi mesh data file
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,4] (1): 2
 ? Enter the name of the file with the SPH gas particles: eagle_gas.dat
 ? Enter the fraction of the metal content locked up in dust grains [0,1] (0.3): 0.3
 ? Enter the maximum temperature for a gas particle to contain dust [0 K,1e6 K] (75000 K):
\endverbatim

For a panchromatic simulation, the only applicable type of dust system is the panchromatic dust system,
which supports thermal dust emission in addition to absorption and scattering.
The dust system is optional, so you need to explicitly select it.

In this tutorial, the dust distribution is imported from the output of an SPH simulation. You need SPH gas particle
data in a format appropriate for importing in SKIRT, as described in the documentation for the function
SPHDustDistribution::setFilename().
Select the appropriate dust distribution type and enter the name of your gas particle data file.

SKIRT estimates the dust density distribution from the gas particle data through a simple scheme:
the dust density is assumed to be proportional to the density of the metallic gas. The proportionality factor
must be provided as a factor. A typical value is 0.3.

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the dust mix describing the attributes of the dust:
      1. A Draine & Li (2007) dust mix
      2. A dust mix with average interstellar properties
      3. A dust mix with mean Zubko properties
      4. A dust mix from the 1D benchmark model (Ivezic et al. 1997)
      5. A dust mix from the 2D benchmark model (Pascucci et al. 2004)
      6. An MRN multi-component dust mix
      7. A Weingartner & Draine multi-component dust mix
      8. A Zubko et al. multi-component dust mix
      9. A configurable multi-component dust mix
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,9] (2): 1
 ? Do you want to output a data file with the optical properties of the dust mix? [yes/no] (yes):
 ? Do you want to output a data file with the mean optical properties of the dust mix? [yes/no] (yes):
\endverbatim

SKIRT supports a set of built-in dust mixtures describing the optical properties of the dust.
Several dust populations, each with their own chemical composition and size distribution, can live together in the
model. All dust populations have the same spatial distribution, but they may have different optical
properties and therefore they will reach different equilibrium temperatures.

For this tutorial, select the default Draine & Li dust mix.
This dust mixture formally consists of a single dust grain population, but effectively
represents a mixture of graphite, silicate and PAH dust grains that reproduces the extinction curve of the Milky Way.

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the dust grid structure:
      1. A 3D cartesian grid structure with a linear distribution
      2. A 3D cartesian grid structure with a power-law distribution
      3. A 3D dust grid structure with a two-phase medium
      4. An octtree dust grid structure
      5. A k-d tree (binary tree) dust grid structure
      6. A tree dust grid structure derived from a set of particles
      7. A Voronoi dust grid structure
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,7] (4): 4
 ? Do you want to output data files for plotting the structure of the grid? [yes/no] (yes):
 ? Enter the outer radius of the root cell in the x direction [0 pc,.. pc]: 20 kpc
 ? Enter the outer radius of the root cell in the y direction [0 pc,.. pc]: 20 kpc
 ? Enter the outer radius of the root cell in the z direction [0 pc,.. pc]: 20 kpc
 ? Enter the minimum level of grid refinement (typically 2 to 3) [0,50] (2): 2
 ? Enter the maximum level of grid refinement (typically 6 to 10) [2,50] (6): 7
   Possible choices for the search method used for traversing the tree grid:
      1. Top-down (start at root and recursively find appropriate child node)
      2. Neighbor (construct and use neighbor list for each node wall)
      3. Bookkeeping (derive appropriate neighbor through node indices)
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (2):
 ? Enter the number of random density samples for determining cell subdivision [10,1000] (100):
 ? Enter the maximum mean optical depth for each dust cell [0,100] (0):
 ? Enter the maximum fraction of dust mass contained in each dust cell [0,0.01] (1e-6): 5e-5
 ? Enter the maximum density dispersion fraction in each dust cell [0,0.01] (0):
 ? Do you want to use barycentric subdivision? [yes/no] (no):
\endverbatim

Usually you have little a priori knowledge about a dust distribution imported from SPH simulation results.
Due to the lack of spatial symmetries, the grid structure that discretizes the dust must be a full 3D grid.
Moreover, since we have no a priori information on where the denser regions are located, it is best to choose
an adaptive grid that automatically forms smaller cells in denser regions. The grid will take longer to construct,
but the simulation run will be faster and more accurate than if you would use a more uniform grid.

For this tutorial simulation, select an octtree grid. The grid must enclose most of the dust
in the system so its size must be adjusted to the configuration space of the input data.
For the \c eagle_xxx.dat particle data files, you should specify an extent of 20 kpc in each direction.

For a first simulation, typical values for the grid refinement level are a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 7.
For high-quality simulations, you will need to raise the maximum level to 10 or more, so that
the resulting octtree contains more and smaller cells. Of course this strongly raises execution time.

For this tutorial simulation, the maximum fraction of dust mass in each cell may be set to a value of
\f$5\times 10^{-5}\f$. For high-quality simulations, this parameter is usually left to the default value
of \f$10^{-6}\f$. Larger (and thus less stringent) values for this parameter result in an octtree with less cells,
which lowers accuracy as well as execution time.

Leave the other parameters to their default values.

\verbatim
 ? Enter the number of random density samples for determining cell mass [10,1000] (100):
 ? Do you want to output a data file with convergence checks on the dust system? [yes/no] (yes):
 ? Do you want to output FITS files displaying the dust density distribution? [yes/no] (yes):
 ? Do you want to calculate and output quality metrics for the dust grid? [yes/no] (no):
 ? Do you want to output a data file with relevant properties for all dust cells? [yes/no] (no):
 ? Do you want to output statistics on the number of cells crossed per path? [yes/no] (no):
   Possible choices for the dust emissivity type:
      1. Modified blackbody dust emissivity (assumes LTE conditions)
      2. Transient heating dust emissivity (with full non-LTE treatment)
      3. Transient heating dust emissivity using the external DustEM code
 ? Enter one of these numbers or zero to select none [0,3] (1):
   Possible choices for the dust library mechanism:
      1. A dust library that calculates the emissivity for every dust cell
      2. A dust library with a one-dimensional grid of emissivity entries
      3. A dust library with a two-dimensional grid of emissivity entries
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (1):
 ? Do you want to include dust self-absorption? [yes/no] (yes): no
 ? Do you want to output a file with the dust mix emissivities in the local ISRF? [yes/no] (no):
 ? Do you want to output FITS files displaying the dust temperature distribution? [yes/no] (yes):
 ? Do you want to output a data file describing the interstellar radiation field? [yes/no] (yes):
\endverbatim

As soon as a simulation includes a dust system, dust absorption and scattering are automatically enabled.
For a panchromatic simulation you can also enable thermal emission by the dust. To enable thermal emission,
select one of the dust emissivity options (see next paragraph). To disable thermal emission, enter zero to
select "no dust emissivity".
If the simulation's wavelength range includes MIR or FIR bands, dust emission is most likely relevant.
If the simulation covers UV and optical bands only, dust emission is most likely irrelevant.

With the default "modified blackbody" dust emissivity option, thermal emission is calculated under the assumption
of local thermal equilibrium (LTE). Alternatively you can select "transient heating" dust emissivity, which supports
non-LTE (NLTE) dust emission by transiently heated small grains.
This is a lot more resource-intensive but produces more realistic results for the NIR and MIR wavelengths.
When a dust grid contains many cells, it may not be feasible to calculate the NLTE dust emission for the exact
radiation field in each and every dust cell (since the calculation is so resource-intensive). To help address
this issue, <tt>SKIRT</tt> offers a library mechanism that selects a small set of radiation fields relevant to the range
detected in the dust grid, performs the thermal emission calculation for each of these library entries, and then
maps each dust grid cell to one of these entries. There are versions of the library mechanism with a 1D and a 2D grid.
The default mechanism simply calculates the thermal emission for every cell, so it is not really a library.

Finally, if dust emission is enabled, you can also enable dust self-absorption, implying a self-consistent calculation
of the dust temperature through an iterative (and time-consuming) procedure.
The relevance of dust self-absorption depends on the optical depth of the modeled system: if there is a
modest amount of dust, the system is transparent to long-wavelength radiation, so self-absorption by dust is
negligible. If the system is rather opaque, it will absorb also mid- and far-infrared
radiation, so self-absorption might be important.

For this tutorial simulation, use the default "modified blackbody" dust emissivity and the default "for every dust
cell" library mechanism (since the LTE calculation is very fast, you can just as well do it for every cell).
However it is best to disable dust self-absorption since it has no effect for this optically-thin model.
Leave the other parameters to their default values.

\section UserTut2Run Running the simulation

After all questions have been answered, <tt>SKIRT</tt> writes out the resulting ski file and terminates.
Start <tt>SKIRT</tt> again, this time specifying the name of new ski file on the command line, to actually perform
the simulation.

\section UserTut2Output Output files

Most of the output files for this tutorial simulation have already been described for the previous tutorial.
A notable exception is the file written by the SED instrument:
 - \c PanSPH_i90_sed.dat is a short text data file representing the spectral energy distribution of the photon
    packages detected by the instrument; there are two columns (wavelength, flux) that can easily be plotted.

The output files describing sections of the dust with the coordinate planes now come in triples
(\c xy, \c xz and \c yz) because there are no symmetries (i.e. the dust grid is fully 3D).
There are also some additional files describing aspects of the dust system that make sense only for
panchromatic simulations:
 - \c PanSPH_ds_tempxy.fits, \c xz & \c yz ("temperature") are single-frame FITS data files,
   each providing a 1024 x 1024 pixel map of the mean dust temperature in a coordinate plane, across
   the total extension of the dust grid.
 - \c PanSPH_ds_isrf.dat ("interstellar radiation field") is a text format data file describing the
   radiation field (flux for every wavelength) for each dust cell in the dust grid.

If you enable NLTE dust emission, there will be one or more files with names of the form
\c PanSPH_*_EXT.RES and \c PanSPH_*_ISRF.DAT, where * stands for a decimal number. These are temporary files
and can be discarded.
