\section StochasticHeatingIntro Introduction

Thermal emission by stochastically heated dust grains plays an important role in the radiative transfer problem for a
dusty medium. It is therefore essential to verify that radiative transfer codes properly calculate the dust emission
before studying the effects of spatial distribution and other model parameters on the simulated observables.

This benchmark includes the optical and calorimetric material properties and the grain size distributions for a typical
astronomical dust mixture, and provides dust emission reference solutions for a range of well-defined input radiation
fields.

\section StochasticHeatingResults SKIRT results

The \c SKIRT team lead this benchmark effort in cooperation with the authors of five other radiative transfer codes.
The figures below show the total emissivities for the full solution (i.e. stochastically heated grains) calculated by
each of the codes participating in the benchmark and the corresponding reference solution. The input fields are very
weak for the panel at the left, and moderately strong for the panel at the right. In the upper plot of each panel, the
reference solution is represented by the dashed curve (barely visible), while in the difference plot it is represented
by the zero-line.

To perform this benchmark, download the ski file provided above (\ref StochasticHeatingRefs) and pass it to \c SKIRT as
a single command line argument. After about 15 seconds, \c SKIRT produces an output file for each of the input fields
in the benchmark. The emissivity is listed in a seperate column for each material type in the benchmark dust mixture
(in the order Silicates, Graphite, and PAHs, corresponding to the order in which these components are specified in the
ski file). Thus you need to add those three columns to obtain the total emissivity of the dust mixture as shown in the
above figures.
