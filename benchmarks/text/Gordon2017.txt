\section GordonIntro Introduction

Gordon et al. 2017 present a 3D continuum radiative transfer benchmark problem composed of a slab of dust with uniform
density externally illuminated by a star. The aim is to test dust absorption, scattering, and emission, optionally
taking into account stochastic heating of dust grains in non-LTE conditions (see \ref StochasticHeating). The authors
provide results produced by seven different radiative transfer codes, including \c SKIRT, for several optical depths
and viewing angles. The \c SKIRT team participated in this benchmark effort.

\section GordonResults SKIRT results

The diagram below on the left illustrates the benchmark setup including the viewing angles. The figure on the right
shows the SEDs calculated taking into account stochastic heating for all optical depth values in the benchmark and for
selected viewing angles.

The figure below shows images produced by \c SKIRT for the \f$\tau_z(1~\mu\text{m}) = 0.1\f$ case calculated taking
into account stochastic heating for two representative wavelengths. Many more results and comparisons between the
results produced by \c SKIRT and the other participating codes are presented in the paper, and can be consulted on the
benchmark web site (see \ref GordonRefs).

To perform this benchmark, download the ski file and input data files provided above (\ref GordonRefs). Open the ski
file in a text editor to adjust the following parameter values to a particular benchmark configuration:

| Parameter         | XML element                              | XML attribute    |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Optical depth     | \c ZDustCompNormalization                | \em opticalDepth |
| Number of dust grid bins along Z-axis     | \c meshZ/LinMesh | \em numBins      |
| Number of pixels in the instrument frames | \c FullInstrument | \em numPixelsX ; \em numPixelsY |

The dust grid resolution must be increased for the highest optical depth to ensure correct results. Similarly, the
instrument resolution is increased to properly show the resulting surface brightness gradients. The appropriate values
are:

| Optical depth | Dust grid bins along Z-axis | Pixels in instrument frames |
|---------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
|  0.01 |  31 | 300 |
|  0.1  |  31 | 300 |
|  1    |  31 | 300 |
| 10    | 201 | 600 |

Then pass the (name of) the ski file to \c SKIRT as a single command line argument. Higher optical depths lead to
longer simulation run times. At the end of the simulation run, \c SKIRT outputs data cubes and SEDs which can
be compared to the original benchmark results.
