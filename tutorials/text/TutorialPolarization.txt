\page TutorialPolarization Dust scattering polarization signatures of spiral galaxies

In this tutorial you will build a basic spiral galaxy model that includes the effects of polarization caused by the
scattering of stellar radiation by spherical dust grains. You will discover a signature of the spiral arms in the
polarization degree of the observed radiation, at least for this simplified model.

\section TutorialPolarizationPre Getting ready

This tutorial assumes that you have completed the introductory \c SKIRT tutorials titled "Monochromatic simulation of a
dusty disk galaxy" and "Panchromatic simulation of a dust torus", or that you have otherwise acquired the working
knowlegde introduced there. At the very least, before starting this tutorial, you should have installed the \c SKIRT
code and a FITS file viewer (preferably DS9). If you have \c PTS installed (optional), you can also experiment with the
visualization options it offers.

To avoid spending time creating yet another \c SKIRT configuration file from scratch, the \c SKIRT web site offers a
fully configured \em ski file that will serve as a basis for this advanced tutorial. Download the file \c
tutorial_polarization_parameters.xml from the <a href="../version8/_downloads.html">SKIRT downloads page</a> and put it
into your local working directory.


\section TutorialPolarizationIntro Polarization background

\subsection TutorialPolarizationIntroStokes Stokes vector

The polarization state of electromagnetic radiation is commonly described by the Stokes vector, \f$\boldsymbol{S}\f$,

\f[
\boldsymbol{S} = \begin{pmatrix} I \\ Q \\ U \\ V \end{pmatrix},
\f]

where \f$I\f$ represents the intensity of the radiation, \f$Q\f$ and \f$U\f$ describe linear polarization, and \f$V\f$
describes circular polarization. The degree of linear polarization,\f$P_{\text{L}}\f$, can be
written as a function of the Stokes parameters,

\f[
P_{\text{L}} = \frac{\sqrt{Q^2+U^2}}{I}.
\f]

The (linear) polarization angle, \f$\gamma\f$, can be written as

\f[
\gamma = \frac12\arctan_2\left(\frac{U}{Q}\right),
\f]

where \f$\arctan_2\f$ denotes the inverse tangent function that preserves the quadrant. Combining these equations,
we can also write

\f[
Q = I P_{\text{L}} \cos2\gamma,\\
U = I P_{\text{L}} \sin2\gamma.
\f]

The values of \f$Q\f$ and \f$U\f$ depend on the polarization angle \f$\gamma\f$, which describes the angle between the
direction of linear polarization and a given reference direction in the plane orthogonal to the propagation direction.
The angle is measured counter-clockwise when looking at the source. The reference direction can be chosen arbitrarily
as long as it is well defined and perpendicular to the propagation direction. However, when the polarization state
changes as a result of an interaction (e.g., a scattering event), most recipes for properly adjusting the Stokes vector
require the reference direction to have a specific orientation (e.g., lying in the scattering plane). Before applying
the recipe, the existing reference direction must be rotated about the propagation direction to match this requirement.
This is accomplished by multiplying the Stokes vector by a rotation matrix, \f${\bf{R}}(\varphi)\f$,

\f[
\boldsymbol{S}_\text{new} = {\bf{R}}(\varphi)\,\boldsymbol{S}.
\f]

A rotation about the direction of propagation by an angle \f$\varphi\f$, counter-clockwise when looking toward the
source of the beam, is described by the matrix

\f[
{\bf{R}}(\varphi)
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \cos2\varphi & \sin2\varphi & 0 \\
0 & -\sin2\varphi & \cos2\varphi & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}.
\f]

To record the polarization state change for a scattering event, the Stokes vector is multiplied by the Müller matrix,
\f${\bf{M}}\f$, corresponding to the event, assuming that the reference direction lies in the scattering plane (as well
as in the plane orthogonal to the propagation direction). The Müller matrix components depend on the geometry of the
scattering event and the physical properties of the scatterer, and they often depend on the wavelength. In general, the
Müller matrix is

\f[
{\bf{M}(\theta,\lambda)}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
S_{11} & S_{12} & S_{13} & S_{14} \\
S_{21} & S_{22} & S_{23} & S_{24} \\
S_{31} & S_{32} & S_{33} & S_{34} \\
S_{41} & S_{42} & S_{43} & S_{44}
\end{pmatrix},
\f]

where \f$\theta\f$ is the angle between the propagation directions before and after the scattering event, and \f$\lambda\f$ is
the wavelength of the radiation. For clarity of presentation, we drop the dependencies from the notation for the
individual Müller matrix components. Including the reference direction adjustments before and after the actual
scattering event, \f$\varphi\f$ and \f$\varphi_\text{new}\f$, the transformation of a Stokes vector for a scattering event can
thus be written as

\f[
\boldsymbol{S}_\text{new} = \bf{R}(\varphi_\text{new})\,\bf{M}(\theta,\lambda)\,\bf{R}(\varphi)\,\boldsymbol{S}.
\f]

For scattering by spherical particles, the Müller matrix simplifies to
\f[
{\bf{M_\mathrm{Sph}}}(\theta,\lambda)
=
\begin{pmatrix}
S_{11} & S_{12} & 0 & 0 \\
S_{12} & S_{11} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & S_{33} & S_{34} \\
0 & 0 & -S_{34} & S_{33}
\end{pmatrix},
\f]
again assuming that the reference direction lies in the scattering plane.
The Müller matrices for a particular grain size and material can be calculated using Mie theory.

For scattering by electrons, also called Thomson scattering, the Müller matrix is wavelength-independent and can be
expressed analytically as a function of the scattering angle,

\f[
{\bf{M_\mathrm{Th}}}(\theta)
=\frac12
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos^2\theta +1 & \cos^2\theta -1 & 0 & 0 \\
\cos^2\theta -1 & \cos^2\theta +1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 2\cos\theta & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 &  2\cos\theta
\end{pmatrix}.
\f]

\subsection TutorialPolarizationIntroConventions Conventions

\image html TutorialPolarizationStokes.png

<i>Illustration above</i>: The Stokes vector conventions recommended by the IAU and used in \c SKIRT. The radiation
beam travels along its propagation direction, \f$\boldsymbol{k}\f$, out of the page. The electric field vector
describes an ellipse over time. The linear polarization angle, \f$\gamma\f$, is given by the angle between the primary
axis of the ellipse (green line) and the reference direction, \f$\boldsymbol{k}\f$. The position angle of the electric
field vector increases with time, the beam has right-handed circular polarization.

In \c SKIRT we define the Stokes vector following the recommendations of the International Astronomical Union, as
presented in the previous subsection and illustrated in the figure above. Historically, however, authors have used
various conventions for the signs of the Stokes parameters \f$U\f$ and \f$V\f$. For example, the polarization angle
\f$\gamma\f$ is sometimes measured while looking toward the observer rather than toward the source, flipping the sign
of both $U$ and $V$. Reversing the definition of circular polarization handedness also flips the sign of $V$. Assuming
that the adopted conventions are properly documented, translating the values of the Stokes parameters from one
convention into another is straightforward by flipping the signs appropriately.


\section TutorialPolarizationSpiral Configuring a spiral galaxy with support for polarization

\subsection TutorialPolarizationSpiralBase The basic configuration

Rather than spending time creating yet another \c SKIRT configuration file from scratch, you can start from a
preconfigured \em ski file offered for download on the \c SKIRT web site (see \ref TutorialPolarizationPre).
As a second step you will then enable polarization in this configuration.

Rename the downloaded file from \c tutorial_polarization_parameters.xml to a (shorter) name of your liking ending with
the ".ski" filename extension, for example \c Spiral.ski. Run this \em ski file with \c SKIRT. While it is running
(this will take several minutes), open the ski file in a text editor and examine its contents. You should recognize the
following configuration elements (not necessarily in this order):

 - a panchromatic simulation that uses one million photon packages for each wavelength
 - a wavelength grid with a limited, optical range, and only three wavelength points
 - a spatial geometry with four components:
     - a flattened Sérsic bulge consisting of evolved stars (3500 K)
     - a thicker exponential disk consisting of evolved stars (3500 K), with spiral arm structure
     - a thinner exponential disk consisting of young stars (10000 K), with spiral arm structure
     - an exponential dust disk with spiral arm structure (the arms in the young stellar disk and the dust disk trail
       those in the evolved stellar population by varying the phase zero-points)
 - a dust mixture called \c TrustMeanDustMix, which represents the dust properties used in the Gordon et. al 2017
   \c TRUST benchmark (see <a href="../version8/_benchmarks.html">SKIRT benchmarks</a>)
 - an adaptive octree grid
 - six instruments at various inclinations and azimuth angles

Also note the omission of a dust emission type and library, which means that there will be no dust emission stage in
the simulation (in other words, dust emission is ignored). This ties in to the limited wavelength range and number of
wavelength grid points. These choices were made to limit the runtime and can easily be adjusted if needed.

After the \c SKIRT simulation completes, examine the output. View the total and scattered data frames at various
inclinations and wavelengths until you are satisfied that the results are as expected.

\subsection TutorialPolarizationSpiralEnab Enabling polarization

Enabling polarization in this configuration is strikingly simple. Duplicate the \em ski file and rename the copy,
for example to \c PolSpiral.ski. Open the new file in your text editor and look for the name of the dust mixture,
i.e. \c TrustMeanDustMix. Replace \c TrustMeanDustMix by \c TrustPolarizedMeanDustMix. Done!

Run the updated \em ski file with \c SKIRT, and read on while the simulation is running.

As indicated in the introduction, \c SKIRT supports polarization of radiation by scattering of spherical dust grains.
This feature is automatically enabled if the dust mixture(s) in the configuration offer the appropriate optical
properties (i.e., essentially, the Müller matrix). In that case, the radiation's polarization properties (i.e., the
Stokes vector) are tracked as the photon packages move through the dusty medium, and the FullInstrument records these
properties as photon packages get detected. There is one important caveat: only the FullInstrument supports
polarization. Note also that there is no support for polarized emission, although this could probably be implemented
fairly easily.

The \c TrustPolarizedMeanDustMix class implements optical and calorimetric properties for a "representative grain" of
the grain population, i.e. integrated over the size distribution. This is fine for a treatment of scattering in the
optical range, but when including dust emission the calculation requires specific information for multiple grain size
bins. This is especially true for small grains that are not in local thermal equilibrium.

For this purpose, \c SKIRT includes the \c PolarizedGraphiteGrainComposition and \c PolarizedSilicateGrainComposition
classes that provide optical properties (including the Müller matrix) for graphite and silicate grains as a function of
grain size. These classes are intended to be configured through the \c ConfigurableDustMix class. For example, one
might configure a version of the \c MRNDustMix (Mathis, Rumpl & Nordsieck 1977) with polarization support as follows.

\verbatim
<mix type="DustMix">
    <ConfigurableDustMix writeMix="true" writeMeanMix="true" writeSize="true">
        <populations type="DustMixPopulation">
            <DustMixPopulation numGrainSizes="3">
                <composition type="GrainComposition">
                    <PolarizedGraphiteGrainComposition/>
                </composition>
                <sizeDistribution type="GrainSizeDistribution">
                    <PowerLawGrainSizeDistribution proportionalityFactor="7.413102413e-31"
                        minSize="0.005 micron" maxSize="0.25 micron" exponent="3.5"/>
                </sizeDistribution>
            </DustMixPopulation>
            <DustMixPopulation numGrainSizes="4">
                <composition type="GrainComposition">
                    <PolarizedSilicateGrainComposition/>
                </composition>
                <sizeDistribution type="GrainSizeDistribution">
                    <PowerLawGrainSizeDistribution proportionalityFactor="7.762471166e-31"
                        minSize="0.005 micron" maxSize="0.25 micron" exponent="3.5"/>
                </sizeDistribution>
            </DustMixPopulation>
        </populations>
    </ConfigurableDustMix>
</mix>
\endverbatim

These classes load the optical dust properties with support for polarization from resource files that are not included
in the code repository. These additional resource files can be downloaded fron the \c SKIRT web site as explained
in the Installation Guide. Look for the section "Downloading additional SKIRT resource files" at the end of the topic
"Basic install using the command line".

Finally, \c SKIRT also includes the class \c ElectronDustMix, which implements wavelength-independent Thomson
scattering. This class was implemented as part of the test scheme for the polarization features in \c SKIRT.


\section TutorialPolarizationVisual Visualizing the results

After the SKIRT simulation with polarization support completes, examine the output directory. For each instrument,
there now are three extra FITS files containing the Stokes Q, U, and V components, in addition to the "totals" file
containing the intensity (i.e. the Stokes I component).

Open the Q and U components for an instrument with face-on inclination in a FITS file viewer, and open an inspector
showing a histogram of the pixel values (DS9->Scale->Parameters). In contrast to the intensity, the other Stokes
components can have negative values. To enhance visualization of the spatial structure, you may need to play with the
color bar scheme, scale and range. It might help to clip the values at zero (i.e. only showing positive values) to
avoid problems with typical color scales such as the log scale.

Compare the 2D structure of the Q and U components. Examine the differences as you browse through the wavelengths.

While the Stokes components correspond to the output of an actual observation, it is much easier to interprete
quantities such as the polarization degree and angle, which can easily be calculated from the Stokes vector.

\subsection TutorialPolarizationVisualPTS Using PTS

If you have the Python Toolkit for \c SKIRT (PTS) installed, you can easily generate plots of polarization degree and
angle for the output of a SKIRT simulation. To generate a default polarization map per instrument and per wavelength,
simply perform (the PDF plot files are placed in a subdirectory called \c _polarization):

\verbatim
$ cd <SKIRT-output-directory>
$ pts plotpolarization
\endverbatim

To get a list of options for the plotpolarization command, enter:

\verbatim
$ pts plotpolarization --help
\endverbatim

For example, to generate a plot of the linear polarization degree averaged over the Y-axis (in addition to the
polarization map), for a particular instrument and wavelength, you might enter:

\verbatim
$ pts plotpolarization -sim PolSpiral -i i090a120 -w 1 --polAvY
\endverbatim

\subsection TutorialPolarizationVisualScript Using your own scripts

Alternatively, you can use plain Python (or any other scripting language or system that supports FITS files)
to process the SKIRT output to your liking. For example:

\verbatim
import numpy as np
import astropy.io.fits as pyfits

I = pyfits.getdata("PolSpiral_i000a120_total.fits")
Q = pyfits.getdata("PolSpiral_i000a120_stokesQ.fits")
U = pyfits.getdata("PolSpiral_i000a120_stokesU.fits")
V = pyfits.getdata("PolSpiral_i000a120_stokesV.fits")

PL = np.sqrt(Q*Q + U*U) / I
GAMMA = 0.5 * (np.arctan2(U,Q) + np.pi)

pyfits.writeto("PolSpiral_i000a120_PL.fits", PL)
pyfits.writeto("PolSpiral_i000a120_GAMMA.fits", GAMMA)
\endverbatim


\section TutorialPolarizationInterp Interpreting the results

\image html TutorialPolarizationSpirals.jpg

The above figure shows surface brightness maps (color scale) overlaid with linear polarization maps (line segments) for
variations on the spiral galaxy model built in this tutorial, observed at a wavelength of \f$1 \mu\mathrm{m}\f$. The
top row shows the model face-on, the second row inclined (\f$53^\circ\f$), and the third row edge-on. The panels in the
bottom row plot the linear polarization degree for the edge-on view, averaged over the vertical axis. This average is
obtained by summing each individual component of the Stokes vector and calculating the polarization degree from these
totals.

The leftmost column shows the reference model (i.e. using the instrument with a zero azimuth). The polarization degree
is up to 1\% around the central part of the models. The orientation of the polarization is circular around the central
bulge, and for the inclined view the polarization degree left and right of the center increases, while it decreases
behind and in front of it. There is a clear spiral structure in the polarization map. The linear polarization degree is
higher in the arm regions and disappears in the interarm region. The maximum polarization degree is slightly inward
from the regions of the arms with the highest flux. Regions with higher linear polarization (up to 2\%) clearly trace
the spiral arms and are prominent at all inclinations, including the edge-on view. The maxima in the polarization
signature of the edge-on view match the positions of the spiral arms along the line of sight.

To verify this, the middle column of the figure shows the same model using the instrument with an azimuth angle of
\f$120^\circ\f$. The peaks in the polarization signature align with the tangent points of the spiral arms, which are
now farther out from the center of the galaxy.

The rightmost column of the figure shows a model that has no spiral arm perturbations in the stellar disks. The
polarization signature remains essentially unchanged; the maxima are slightly higher (by a factor of up to 1.2), but
the structure is the same. This seems to confirm that the polarization signature is created by the distribution of the
dust and not by the distribution of the sources.

These results imply that polarization measurements could be used, at least in principle, to study the spiral structure of
edge-on spiral galaxies, where intensity measurements alone have limited diagnostic power.
