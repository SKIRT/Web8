\page TutorialBasicsPan Panchromatic simulation of a dust torus with SKIRT

\image html TutorialBasicsPan.png

In this tutorial you will use <tt>SKIRT</tt> to produce the spectral energy distribution (see illustration) and a full
data cube for a dust torus surrounding a central stellar source. You will create a \em ski file containing the
appropriate simulation parameters, perform the simulation, and review and interpret the simulation results.

\section TutorialBasicsPanPre Getting ready

This tutorial assumes that you have completed the introductory <tt>SKIRT</tt> tutorial titled "Monochromatic simulation
of a dusty disk galaxy", or that you have otherwise acquired the working knowlegde introduced there. At the very least,
before starting this tutorial, you should have installed the <tt>SKIRT</tt> code, some means to plot column text files
(preferably <tt>PTS</tt>), and a FITS file viewer (preferably DS9).

\section TutorialBasicsPanSki Creating the ski file

In a Terminal window, with an appropriate current directory, start <tt>SKIRT</tt> without any command line arguments.
SKIRT responds with a welcome message and starts an interactive session in the terminal window, during which it
will prompt you for all the information describing a particular simulation:

\verbatim
   Welcome to SKIRT v___
   Interactively constructing a simulation...
 ? Enter the name of the ski file to be created: PanTorus
\endverbatim

The first question is for the filename of the \em ski file. For this tutorial, enter "PanTorus".

\section TutorialBasicsPanSim Type of simulation

\verbatim
   Possible choices for a Monte Carlo simulation:
      1. An oligochromatic Monte Carlo simulation
      2. A panchromatic Monte Carlo simulation
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,2] (1): 2
\endverbatim

In this tutorial the goal is to produce a spectral energy distribution (%SED) and an integral field data cube including
infrared wavelengths and thus the effects of thermal emission by the dust. Calculating the dust temperature requires
integrating over a range of wavelengths, so, by definition this requires a panchromatic simulation.

Leave the seed for the random generator to its default value (not shown).

\section TutorialBasicsPanUni Units

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the units system:
      1. SI units
      2. Stellar units (length in AU, distance in pc)
      3. Extragalactic units (length in pc, distance in Mpc)
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (3): 2
   Possible choices for the output style for flux density and surface brightness:
      1. Neutral: lambda F_lambda = nu F_nu
      2. Wavelength: F_lambda
      3. Frequency: F_nu
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (1): 3
\endverbatim

You will be setting up a dust torus surrounding a stellar source, so it is most convenient to use stellar units with
sizes expressed in astronomical units. Select the frequency output style, expressing integrated fluxes in Jy and
surface densities in MJy/sr.

\section TutorialBasicsPanWave Wavelength grid

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the wavelength grid:
      1. A logarithmic wavelength grid
      2. A nested logarithmic wavelength grid
      3. A wavelength grid read from a file
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (1): 2
 ? Do you want to output a data file listing the wavelength grid points? [yes/no] (no):
 ? Enter the shortest wavelength of the low-resolution grid [0.0001 micron,1e6 micron]: 0.25
 ? Enter the longest wavelength of the low-resolution grid [0.0001 micron,1e6 micron]: 250
 ? Enter the number of grid points in the low-resolution grid [3,2000000000] (25): 20
 ? Enter the shortest wavelength of the high-resolution subgrid [0.0001 micron,1e6 micron]: 5
 ? Enter the longest wavelength of the high-resolution subgrid [0.0001 micron,1e6 micron]: 25
 ? Enter the number of grid points in the high-resolution subgrid [3,2000000000] (25): 20
\endverbatim

<tt>SKIRT</tt> works with a fixed wavelength grid, i.e. a list of \f$N_\lambda\f$ wavelengths.
There are three possibilities: a simple logarithmic grid, a logarithmic grid with a nested
logarithmic subgrid, and a wavelength grid loaded from a file. Here are some guidelines for an
appropriate choice of the wavelength grid:
 - The coverage of your wavelength grid should be appropriate to the radiative transfer problem.
   Typically radiation is absorbed at UV and optical wavelengths and re-emitted at far-infrared and submillimeter
   wavelengths. So your wavelength grid should typically range from the UV to the submm range,
   i.e. from about 0.1 to 1000 \f$\mu\f$m.
 - On the other hand, don't make your wavelength coverage too large. In order to make a meaningul simulation,
   <tt>SKIRT</tt> must know the spectral properties of the emitters (the stars) and the optical properties of the dust
   at all wavelengths considered. Usually, you should not include wavelengths shorter than 0.01 \f$\mu\f$m or
   longer than a few thousand \f$\mu\f$m.
 - You should include a number of wavelength grid points that ensures sufficient resolution and precision.
   On the other hand, the simulation run time is roughly proportional
   to the number of grid points in the wavelength grid. A typical setup uses about 20 grid points for every
   order in wavelength. If you want much more resolution in a certain wavelength range, for example because
   you are studying a spectral region in detail, you can use the nested logarithmic grid.
 - Whatever you decide to do, always make sure that the wavelength grid includes the V band, since the central
   wavelength of the V band is where the optical properties of the dust are normalized. If 0.550 \f$\mu\f$m
   is not covered by your wavelength grid, <tt>SKIRT</tt> will terminate.

For this tutorial, choose a nested logarithmic wavelength grid ranging from 0.25 to 250 \f$\mu\f$m, with a finer
subgrid in the range from 5 to 25 \f$\mu\f$m. This range is sufficiently wide for the tutorial model (as you will be
able to verify from the results). The finer subgrid in the infrared is necessary to properly resolve the dust emission
features in that range. Specify a number of 25 grid points in each range. The points of the courser grid that happen to
lie inside the finer grid range are automatically removed, so the total number of grid points will be smaller than 50.

\section TutorialBasicsPanStel Stellar system

\verbatim
   ...
   Possible choices for item #1 in the stellar components list:
      1. A stellar component with a built-in geometry (in an panchromatic simulation)
         ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,4] (1):
   Possible choices for the geometry of the spatial stellar distribution:
      1. A point source geometry
      ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,46] (1):
\endverbatim

The stellar source for this tutorial is modeled by a point source in the origin. Select a stellar component with
built-in geometry, and a point source geometry (the default choice in both cases).

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the spectral energy distribution for the stellar component:
      1. A black body SED
      2. The SED of the Sun
      3. A Pegase galaxy SED
         ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,11] (1): 2
   Possible choices for the type of normalization for the stellar component:
      1. Stellar component normalization through the bolometric luminosity
      2. Stellar component normalization through the luminosity at a given wavelength
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,2] (1):
 ? Enter the bolometric luminosity for this component ]0 Lsun,.. Lsun[: 1
   ...
\endverbatim

In addition to the spatial distribution of the source (which is trivial in this case), you need to provide its emission
spectrum and luminosity. <tt>SKIRT</tt> offers several built-in options for this purpose, and allows loading a custom
%SED from a file. For this tutorial, specify the solar emission spectrum normalized to the bolometric luminosity of the
sun. When asked for a second stellar component, enter zero to terminate the list.

\section TutorialBasicsPanDust Dust system

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the dust system:
      1. A dust system for use with panchromatic simulations
 ? Enter one of these numbers or zero to select none [0,1] (1):
   Possible choices for the dust distribution:
      1. A dust distribution composed of various dust components
         ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,5] (1):
\endverbatim

For a panchromatic simulation, the only applicable type of dust system is the panchromatic dust system, which supports
thermal dust emission in addition to absorption and scattering. The dust system is optional, so you need to explicitly
select it. The dust distribution in this tutorial is composed of a single built-in component describing a torus. So you
need to select the "component" dust distribution type.

\verbatim
   ...
   Possible choices for item #1 in the dust components list:
   Possible choices for the geometry of the dust component:
      1. A point source geometry
         ...
     14. A torus geometry
         ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,46] (9): 14
 ? Enter the radial powerlaw exponent p of the torus [0,..[: 0
 ? Enter the polar index q of the torus [0,..[: 0
 ? Enter the half opening angle of the torus [0 deg,90 deg]: 10
 ? Enter the minimum radius of the torus [0 AU,.. AU[: 0.5
 ? Enter the maximum radius of the torus [0 AU,.. AU[: 40
 ? Reshape the inner radius according to the Netzer luminosity profile? [yes/no] (no):
\endverbatim

For this tutorial, select a torus geometry with a uniform density distribution (hence the zero values for the power-law
exponent and the polar index), a half opening angle of 10 degrees and a radius range from 0.5 to 40 AU. A uniform dust
density distribution is not very realistic, but it facilitates interpreting the results of this tutorial simulation.

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the dust mixture of the dust component:
      1. A dust mix with average interstellar properties
      2. A Draine & Li (2007) dust mix
      3. A dust mix with mean Zubko properties
         ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,15] (1): 3
 ? Output the optical properties of the dust mix? [yes/no] (yes):
 ? Output the mean optical properties of the dust mix? [yes/no] (yes):
   Possible choices for the type of normalization for the dust component:
      1. Normalization by defining the total dust mass
         ...
      4. Normalization by defining the edge-on optical depth at some wavelength
         ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,7] (1): 4
 ? Enter the wavelength at which to specify the optical depth [0.0001 micron,1e6 micron]: 0.55
 ? Enter the edge-on optical depth at this wavelength ]0,..[: 1
   ...
\endverbatim

In addition to the spatial distribution of the dust, you need to provide its optical and calorimetric properties.
<tt>SKIRT</tt> offers a wide range of options to defined the properties of a dust mixture, which can be categorized as
follows. On the most basic level, <tt>SKIRT</tt> includes some "turn-key" dust mixes that describe a dust population
consisting of identical, representative dust grains. The properties of the representative dust grain are averaged over
several grain materials and over the grain size distribution for each material. With these representative properties
<tt>SKIRT</tt> can produce an exact solution for scattering and absorption in the UV/optical, but not for the dust
emission. A more accurate calculation of the dust emission spectrum requires specification of the material properties
and grain size distribution for each type of dust seperately. <tt>SKIRT</tt> includes some "turn-key" dust mixes that
provide this level of detail and require very little extra configuration. On the other hand, it is also possible to
specify a custom dust mix with fully configurable grain compositions and size distributions.

For this tutorial, specify the "mean Zubko" turn-key dust mix, which describes the representative properties for a
specific dust model including graphite, silicate and PAH dust grains. Indirectly determine the amount of dust in the
model by specifying that the V-band edge-on optical depth of the torus is \f$\tau^\mathrm{e}_V=1\f$. Finally, when
asked for the second dust component, terminate the list by entering zero.

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the dust grid:
      1. An axisymmetric dust grid in spherical coordinates
      2. An axisymmetric dust grid in cylindrical coordinates
      3. A cartesian dust grid
         ...
      5. An octtree dust grid
         ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,8] (5): 2
 ? Output data files for plotting the structure of the grid? [yes/no] (yes):
 ? Enter the cylindrical radius of the grid ]0 AU,.. AU[: 40
 ? Enter the start point of the cylinder in the Z direction ]-.. AU,.. AU[: -10
 ? Enter the end point of the cylinder in the Z direction ]-.. AU,.. AU[: 10
   Possible choices for the bin distribution in the radial direction:
      1. A linear mesh
      2. A power-law mesh
      3. A symmetric power-law mesh
      4. A logarithmic mesh
      5. A mesh read from a file
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,5] (1): 2
 ? Enter the number of bins in the mesh [1,100000] (100): 100
 ? Enter the bin width ratio between the last and the first bin ]0,..[ (1): 20
   Possible choices for the bin distribution in the Z direction:
      1. A linear mesh
      2. A power-law mesh
      3. A symmetric power-law mesh
      4. A mesh read from a file
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,4] (1): 3
 ? Enter the number of bins in the mesh [1,100000] (100): 100
 ? Enter the ratio between the outermost and the innermost bins ]0,..[ (1): 20
\endverbatim

The spatial grid for this tutorial simulation can be two-dimensional, and needs more resolution in the center of the
model. Select a 2D axisymmetric dust grid in cylindrical coordinates with a power-law mesh in the radial direction and
a symmetric power-law mesh in the vertical direction. Specify a grid radius of 40 AU and a grid height of 20 AU
centered on the origin, neatly enclosing the dust torus in the model. Specify 100 cells in each direction, and specify
a ratio of the width of the outermost to the innermost bin of 20 in both directions.

\verbatim
 ? Enter the number of samples for determining cell mass [10,1000] (100):
 ? Output a data file with convergence checks on the dust system? [yes/no] (yes):
 ? Output FITS files displaying the dust density distribution? [yes/no] (yes):
 ? Output FITS file with a V-band optical depth map seen from the center? [yes/no] (no):
   Possible choices for the dust emissivity type:
      1. Modified blackbody dust emissivity (assumes LTE conditions)
 ? Enter one of these numbers or zero to select none [0,1] (1):
   Possible choices for the dust library mechanism:
      1. A dust library that calculates the emissivity for every dust cell
      2. A dust library with a one-dimensional grid of emissivity entries
      3. A dust library with a two-dimensional grid of emissivity entries
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (1):
 ? Do you want to include dust self-absorption? [yes/no] (no):
 ? Output FITS files displaying the dust temperature distribution? [yes/no] (yes):
\endverbatim

The remaining dust system parameters can be left to their default values. These options are described in more detail in
another tutorial.

\section TutorialBasicsPanInst Instrument system

\verbatim
   ...
   Possible choices for item #1 in the instruments list:
      1. A basic instrument that outputs the total integrated flux as an SED
      2. A basic instrument that outputs the total flux in every pixel as a data cube
      3. A basic instrument that outputs the total flux as data cube and as SED
         ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers or zero to terminate the list [0,5] (3): 3
 ? Enter the name for this instrument: i00
 ? Enter the distance to the system ]0 pc,.. pc[: 100
 ? Enter the inclination angle of the detector [0 deg,180 deg] (0 deg):
 ? Enter the azimuth angle of the detector [-360 deg,360 deg] (0 deg):
 ? Enter the position angle of the detector [-360 deg,360 deg] (0 deg):
 ? Enter the total field of view in the horizontal direction ]0 AU,.. AU[: 80
 ? Enter the number of pixels in the horizontal direction [1,10000] (250): 800
 ? Enter the center of the frame in the horizontal direction ]-.. AU,.. AU[ (0 AU):
 ? Enter the total field of view in the vertical direction ]0 AU,.. AU[: 80
 ? Enter the number of pixels in the vertical direction [1,10000] (250): 800
 ? Enter the center of the frame in the vertical direction ]-.. AU,.. AU[ (0 AU):
   Possible choices for item #2 in the instruments list:
      1. A basic instrument that outputs the total integrated flux as an SED
      2. A basic instrument that outputs the total flux in every pixel as a data cube
      3. A basic instrument that outputs the total flux as data cube and as SED
         ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers or zero to terminate the list [0,5] (3): 3
 ? Enter the name for this instrument: i90
 ? Enter the distance to the system ]0 pc,.. pc[: 100
 ? Enter the inclination angle of the detector [0 deg,180 deg] (0 deg): 90
   ... [remaining questions: same answers as for first instrument]
   ...
\endverbatim

For this tutorial, the intention is to create both an %SED and an integral field data cube for each line of sight under
study, i.e. a face-on view and an edge-on view. Therefore, you need to include two instruments of the default type
"that outputs the total flux as data cube and as SED". For the first instrument, specify an inclination of 0 degrees
and a corresponding name, such as "i00" or "faceon". For the second instrument, specify an inclination of 90 degrees
and a name such as "i90" or "edgeon". The azimuth angle is irrelevant because the simulated model will be axisymmetric,
and the position angle (which rotates the instrument frame in its own plane) is best left at zero. For both
instruments, specify a distance of 100 pc, and a field of view of 80 AU and 800 pixels in both directions, centered on
the origin. When asked for a third instrument, enter zero to terminate the list.

\section TutorialBasicsPanPhot Photon packages

\verbatim
 ? Enter the number of photon packages per wavelength [0,1e15] (1e6): 5e5
\endverbatim

The run time of a panchromatic <tt>SKIRT</tt> simulation is roughly proportional to the product of the number of photon
packages and the number of wavelengths. To limit the run time for this tutorial, set the number of photon packages to
\f$5\times10^5\f$. This number is sufficient to produce a reasonable %SED for the simple 2D tutorial model, but the
frames in the data cube will still be quite noisy.

\section TutorialBasicsPanRun Running the simulation

To run the simulation, enter the following command (with the same current directory):

\verbatim
$ skirt PanTorus
   Welcome to SKIRT v___
   Constructing a simulation from ski file 'PanTorus.ski'...
   ...
   Starting setup...
   ...
   Starting the stellar emission phase...
   ...
   Starting the dust emission phase...
   ...
   Starting writing results...
   ...
\endverbatim

The <tt>SKIRT</tt> progress log reflects the various stages of the similation. A panchromatic simulation run includes a
dust emission phase in addition to the stellar emission phase. During the stellar emission phase, <tt>SKIRT</tt> tracks
the amount of energy absorbed in each dust cell for each wavelength in the simulation's wavelength grid. At the start
of the dust emission phase, <tt>SKIRT</tt> uses this information to calculate the dust temperature and the
corresponding emission spectrum in each dust cell.

\section TutorialBasicsPanOutput Output files

Most of the output files for this tutorial are similar to those already described for the "Monochromatic simulation
of a dusty disk galaxy" tutorial. This section describes the output file types that are new to this tutorial.

The instruments used in this tutorial each produce two files:
- \c PanTorus_iNN_total.fits is a FITS file containing the data cube with the total surface brightness for each pixel
  as detected by the instrument. The data cube has a frame for each wavelength in the simulation's wavelength grid.
- \c PanTorus_iNN_sed.dat is a short text data file representing the spectral energy distribution of the photon
    packages detected by the instrument; there are two columns (wavelength, flux) that can easily be plotted.

There are also some additional files describing aspects of the dust system that make sense only for panchromatic
simulations:
 - \c PanTorus_ds_tempxy.fits & \c xz ("temperature") are FITS data files containing a 1024 x 1024 pixel map of the
   dust temperature in a coordinate plane, across the total extension of the dust grid.
 - \c PanTorus_ds_celltemps.dat is a text data file listing the dust temperature in each cell of the
   dust grid; this information can be used to plot a histogram of the dust temperature distribution.

\section TutorialBasicsPanPTS Plotting SEDs

<tt>PTS</tt> offers a simple way to create a PDF file plotting the SEDs produced by a <tt>SKIRT</tt> simulation. The
SEDs for all instruments are combined on the same figure. After the simulation has completed, make sure that the output
directory is your current directory, and simply enter the command "pts plotseds". The PDF file is placed next to the
original data files with a similar name (the instrument name is removed and the filename extension is replaced by
.pdf):

\verbatim
$ pts plotseds
...
Starting plotseds...
Created PDF grid plot file __/PanTorus_sed.pdf
Finished plotseds
$
\endverbatim

To adjust the axis ranges, open the Python script <code>~/PTS/pts/do/core/plotseds.py</code> in a text editor.
Uncomment and update the lines provided for this purpose, and then rerun "pts plotseds". For example:

\verbatim
# a value of None means that the axis is autoscaled;
# alternatively specify a range through a tuple with min and max values
xlim = None
ylim = None
xlim = ( 0.1, 300 )
ylim = ( 1e-2, 1 )
\endverbatim

\section TutorialBasicsPanRes Interpreting simulation results

As always it is a good idea to open \c PanTorus_ds_convergence.dat in a text editor and check the dust grid convergence
metrics. The expected values should be within a few percent of the actual values. It is also instructive to compare the
theoretical and gridded dust density cuts (e.g. \c PanTorus_ds_trhoxz.fits and \c PanTorus_ds_grhoxz.fits) in a FITS
viewer such as DS9. Note, for example, the grid effects and the varying cell sizes at the edges of the torus in this
tutorial model.

Open the temperature maps (\c PanTorus_ds_tempxy.fits and \c PanTorus_ds_tempxz.fits) with DS9. Evaluate the
temperature gradient in the dust, and look up the minimum and maximum temperature values.

Consider the SEDs plotted in the previous section. It is obvious that the edge-on extinction is a lot stronger than
the face-on extinction, as can be expected from the dust geometry. The effect is especially strong for shorter
wavelengths because the dust grain cross sections are larger in that wavelength regime. The dust emission continuum in
the (far-)infrared is isotropic because the dust is essentially transparent at those wavelengths.

Finally, open the instrument data cubes (\c PanTorus_i00_total.fits and \c PanTorus_i90_total.fits) with DS9 and browse
through the frames (or wavelengths). Manually adjust the range of the pixel values shown, clipping away the extremely
bright central pixel. When comparing between frames, make sure to use the same scale and pixel range. To determine the
wavelength corresponding to a particular frame index in the data cube, open one of the %SED files (e.g. \c
PanTorus_i00_sed.dat) in a text editor: the first column lists the wavelengths.

Interpret the results in the data cubes for each wavelength regime. Outside of the central pixel, the UV/optical
radiation reaching the instruments has been scattered by dust grains in the torus. In the (far-)infrared, the dust
grains re-emit the thermal energy absorbed at shorter wavelengths.
