<i>Illustration above</i>: dust temperature map (along one of the coordinate planes) for the SPH-simulated galaxy
used in this tutorial.

In this tutorial you will use <tt>SKIRT</tt> to study the dust in a galaxy model produced by the EAGLE cosmological
simulations (http://icc.dur.ac.uk/Eagle ; http://eagle.strw.leidenuniv.nl). The EAGLE simulation code, an adjusted
version of Gadget-3 (http://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget), includes a gravitational solver for dark and baryonic
matter and uses smoothed particles to implement the hydrodynamical evolution of the gas (SPH = smoothed particle
hydrodynamics). The simulation results are stored in consecutive snaphots as time progresses. For this tutorial, you
will use data for a single galaxy extracted from the present-day snapshot of an early EAGLE test run. The provided
snapshot data includes information on stellar particles, representing the radiation sources, and on gas particles, from
which a dust distribution can be derived.

The <a href="../skirt8/_concepts.html">SKIRT concepts section</a> includes a concept note that provides a more general
overview of <tt>SKIRT</tt>'s capabilities for postprocessing (magneto-)hydrodynamical simulation results.

\section TutorialHydroSphPre Getting ready

This tutorial assumes that you have completed the introductory <tt>SKIRT</tt> tutorial titled "Monochromatic simulation
of a dusty disk galaxy", or that you have otherwise acquired the working knowlegde introduced there. At the very least,
before starting this tutorial, you should have installed the <tt>SKIRT</tt> code, some means to plot column text files
(preferably <tt>PTS</tt>), and a FITS file viewer (preferably DS9).

To complete this tutorial, you need the files containing the data extracted from the EAGLE snapshot in a format
appropriate for importing into SKIRT. Download the files \c eagle_stars.dat and \c eagle_gas.dat from the <a
href="../version8/_downloads.html">SKIRT downloads page</a> and put them into your local working directory.

\section TutorialHydroSphSki Creating the ski file

In a Terminal window, with an appropriate current directory, start <tt>SKIRT</tt> without any command line arguments.
<tt>SKIRT</tt> responds with a welcome message and starts an interactive session in the terminal window, during which
it will prompt you for all the information describing a particular simulation:

\verbatim
   Welcome to SKIRT v___
   Interactively constructing a simulation...
 ? Enter the name of the ski file to be created: PanEagle
\endverbatim

The first question is for the filename of the \em ski file. For this tutorial, enter "PanEagle".

\section TutorialHydroSphSim Type of simulation

\verbatim
   Possible choices for a Monte Carlo simulation:
      1. An oligochromatic Monte Carlo simulation
      2. A panchromatic Monte Carlo simulation
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,2] (1): 2
   ...
\endverbatim

In this tutorial, the goal is to produce a spectral energy distribution (%SED) including infrared wavelengths and the
effects of the emission by stochastically heated dust grains. By definition this requires a panchromatic simulation.

Leave the seed for the random generator to its default value (not shown).

\section TutorialHydroSphUni Units

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the units system:
      1. SI units
      2. Stellar units (length in AU, distance in pc)
      3. Extragalactic units (length in pc, distance in Mpc)
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (3): 3
   Possible choices for the output style for flux density and surface brightness:
      1. Neutral: lambda F_lambda = nu F_nu
      2. Wavelength: F_lambda
      3. Frequency: F_nu
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (1): 1
\endverbatim

You will be studying a complete galaxy, so it is appropriate to select extragalactic units. For this tutorial, just so
you experience the various options, select the "neutral" output style, expressing integrated fluxes in
\f$\text{W}\,\text{m}^{-2}\f$ and surface densities in \f$\text{W}\,\text{m}^{-2}\,\text{arcsec}^{-2}\f$.

\section TutorialHydroSphWave Wavelength grid

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the wavelength grid:
      1. A logarithmic wavelength grid
      2. A nested logarithmic wavelength grid
      3. A wavelength grid read from a file
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (1): 2
 ? Do you want to output a data file listing the wavelength grid points? [yes/no] (no):
 ? Enter the shortest wavelength of the low-resolution grid [0.0001 micron,1e6 micron]: 0.1
 ? Enter the longest wavelength of the low-resolution grid [0.0001 micron,1e6 micron]: 1000
 ? Enter the number of grid points in the low-resolution grid [3,2000000000] (25): 35
 ? Enter the shortest wavelength of the high-resolution subgrid [0.0001 micron,1e6 micron]: 6
 ? Enter the longest wavelength of the high-resolution subgrid [0.0001 micron,1e6 micron]: 25
 ? Enter the number of grid points in the high-resolution subgrid [3,2000000000] (25): 25
 \endverbatim

<tt>SKIRT</tt> offers three possibilities: a simple logarithmic grid, a logarithmic grid with a nested logarithmic
subgrid, and a wavelength grid loaded from a file. For this tutorial, choose a nested logarithmic wavelength grid
ranging from 0.1 to 1000 \f$\mu\f$m, with a finer subgrid in the range from 5 to 25 \f$\mu\f$m. This grid covers UV,
infared and submillimeter wavelengths and includes a finer subgrid in the infrared to properly resolve the dust
emission features in that range. This is especially important when including the effects of stochastically heated dust
grains, as you will in this tutorial simulation.

Specify 35 points in the wider grid, and 25 points in the nested grid. The points of the courser grid that happen to
lie inside the finer grid range are automatically removed, so the total number of grid points will be smaller than 60.

\section TutorialHydroSphStel Stellar system

\verbatim
   ...
   Possible choices for item #1 in the stellar components list:
      1. A stellar component with a built-in geometry (in an panchromatic simulation)
      2. A stellar component derived from an SPH output file
      ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,4] (1): 2
 ? Enter the name of the file with the SPH source particles: eagle_stars.dat
 ? Do you want to import velocity information from the SPH particle file? [yes/no] (no):
   Possible choices for the SED family used to assign an SED to each particle:
      1. A Bruzual-Charlot SED family for single stellar populations
      2. A Starburst99 SED family for single stellar populations
      3. A MAPPINGS III SED family for starbursting regions
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (1):
 ? Do you want to output a data file with the luminosities per wavelength bin? [yes/no] (no):
   Possible choices for item #2 in the stellar components list:
      1. A stellar component with a built-in geometry (in an panchromatic simulation)
      2. A stellar component derived from an SPH output file
      ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers or zero to terminate the list [0,4] (0):
\endverbatim

In this tutorial, the stellar information is given as a list of smoothed particles in a format appropriate for
importing in <tt>SKIRT</tt>. Each particle represents a single stellar population with certain given properties
including mass, metallicity and age. Select the appropriate stellar component type, enter the name of your stellar
particle data file, and leave the further settings to their default values. Specifically, do not enable velocity
information and select the Bruzual-Charlot family of %SED templates.

Each line in the provided text file represents a smoothed particle. The first three columns specify the \f$x\f$,
\f$y\f$ and \f$z\f$ coordinates of the particle (in pc) and the fourth column is the smoothing length \f$h\f$ (in pc).
If the \em importVelocity flag is set to true, the subsequent three columns (i.e. the fifth through the seventh columns)
contain the \f$v_\mathrm{x}\f$, \f$v_\mathrm{y}\f$ and \f$v_\mathrm{z}\f$ components of the particle's velocity (in
km/s). If the \em importVelocity flag is set to false, these columns are not present.

The number and interpretation of the subsequent columns depends on the specified %SED family. For the Bruzual-Charlot
%SED family, the remaining three columns provide the properties of the stellar population. The fifth column is the
initial mass of the stellar population (in \f$M_\odot\f$ at \f$t=0\f$), the sixth column is the metallicity \f$Z\f$ of
the stellar population (dimensionless fraction), and the seventh column is the age of the stellar population (in yr).

\section TutorialHydroSphDust Dust system

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the dust system:
      1. A dust system for use with panchromatic simulations
 ? Enter one of these numbers or zero to select none [0,1] (1):
   Possible choices for the dust distribution:
      1. A dust distribution composed of various dust components
      2. A dust distribution derived from an SPH output file
         ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,5] (1): 2
 ? Enter the name of the file with the SPH gas particles: eagle_gas.dat
 ? Enter the fraction of the metal content locked up in dust grains [0,1] (0.3): 0.25
 ? Enter the maximum temperature for a gas particle to contain dust [0 K,1e6 K] (75000 K):
\endverbatim

For a panchromatic simulation, the only applicable type of dust system is the panchromatic dust system, which supports
thermal dust emission in addition to absorption and scattering. The dust system is optional, so you need to explicitly
select it.

In this tutorial, the dust distribution is imported from the output of an SPH simulation. You need SPH gas particle
data in a format appropriate for importing in <tt>SKIRT</tt> (see below). Select the appropriate dust distribution type
and enter the name of your gas particle data file. <tt>SKIRT</tt> estimates the dust density distribution from the gas
particle data through a simple scheme: the dust density is assumed to be proportional to the density of the metallic
gas. The proportionality factor must be provided as a parameter; for this tutorial, use a value of 0.25. Leave the
maximum temperature to the default value.

Each line in the imported text file represents a smoothed particle, using 6 or 7 columns. The first three columns are
the \f$x\f$, \f$y\f$ and \f$z\f$ coordinates of the particle (in pc), the fourth column is the SPH smoothing length
\f$h\f$ (in pc), the fifth column is the mass \f$M\f$ of the particle (in \f$M_\odot\f$), and the sixth column is the
metallicity \f$Z\f$ of the gas (dimensionless fraction). The optional seventh column is the temperature of the gas (in
K). If this value is provided and it is higher than the maximum temperature the particle is ignored. If the temperature
value is missing, the particle is never ignored.

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the dust mix describing the attributes of the dust:
      1. A dust mix with average interstellar properties
         ...
     11. A Zubko et al. multi-component dust mix
         ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,15] (1): 11
 ? Output a data file with the optical properties of the dust mix? [yes/no] (yes):
 ? Output a data file with the mean optical properties of the dust mix? [yes/no] (yes):
 ? Output a data file with grain size information for the dust mix? [yes/no] (yes):
 ? Enter the number of graphite grain size bins [1,2000000000] (5):
 ? Enter the number of silicate grain size bins [1,2000000000] (5):
 ? Enter the number of neutral and ionized PAH size bins (each) [1,2000000000] (5):
\endverbatim

<tt>SKIRT</tt> supports a set of built-in dust mixtures describing the optical properties of the dust. A dust mixture
consists one or more dust populations. Each dust population is assumed to contain identical grains that are
representative of the population (i.e. with a given chemical composition and a given, averaged grain size). A
continuous grain size distribution must be discretized into a finite number of populations with specific sizes.

For the purposes of calculating absorption and scattering, the optical properties of a complete dust mixture can be
conveniently averaged over the various populations, resulting in a single representative grain. However, when
calculating the termal emmision spectrum of a dust mixture embedded in a given radiation field, each dust population
must be treated separately. Indeed, the equilibrium temperature of the grains depends on their size as well as on their
material properties. Depending on the radiation field, small grains may even be "stochastically heated", i.e. not in
thermal equilibrium with their environment. In this case, it becomes necessary to compute the probability distribution
of the internal grain energy to determine the emission spectrum. Stochastically heated grains emit at shorter
wavelengths than if they were in equilibrium, which often substantially influences the infrared spectrum of a galaxy.

In this tutorial the intention is to include the effect of stochastically heated dust grains. Select the Zubko dust mix
(\em not the \em mean Zubko dust mix), which has built-in compositions and grain sizes for graphite and silicate grains
and for PAH molecules, but at the same time allows configuring multiple dust populations for each material type. Leave
the number of populations for each grain type at the default value of 5, although in an actual research setting this
number should be higher.

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the dust grid:
      1. A cartesian dust grid
      2. A 3D dust grid with a two-phase medium
      3. An octtree dust grid
      4. A k-d tree (binary tree) dust grid
      5. A tree dust grid derived from a set of particles
      6. A Voronoi dust grid
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,6] (3): 3
 ? Do you want to output data files for plotting the structure of the grid? [yes/no] (yes):
 ? Enter the start point of the box in the X direction ]-.. pc,.. pc[: -20000
 ? Enter the end point of the box in the X direction ]-.. pc,.. pc[: 20000
 ? Enter the start point of the box in the Y direction ]-.. pc,.. pc[: -20000
 ? Enter the end point of the box in the Y direction ]-.. pc,.. pc[: 20000
 ? Enter the start point of the box in the Z direction ]-.. pc,.. pc[: -20000
 ? Enter the end point of the box in the Z direction ]-.. pc,.. pc[: 20000
 ? Enter the minimum level of grid refinement (typically 2 to 3) [0,50] (2): 3
 ? Enter the maximum level of grid refinement (typically 6 to 10) [2,50] (6): 7
   Possible choices for the search method used for traversing the tree grid:
      1. Top-down (start at root and recursively find appropriate child node)
      2. Neighbor (construct and use neighbor list for each node wall)
      3. Bookkeeping (derive appropriate neighbor through node indices)
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (2):
 ? Enter the number of random density samples for determining cell subdivision [10,1000] (100):
 ? Enter the maximum mean optical depth for each dust cell [0,100] (0):
 ? Enter the maximum fraction of dust mass contained in each dust cell [0,0.01] (1e-6): 2e-5
 ? Enter the maximum density dispersion in each dust cell, as fraction of the reference density [0,1] (0):
 ? Do you want to use barycentric subdivision? [yes/no] (no):
   ...
\endverbatim

<tt>SKIRT</tt> discretizes the dust on a spatial grid, i.e. a collection of small cells in which properties such as
dust density and temperature are considered to be uniform. Usually you have little a priori knowledge about a dust
distribution imported from SPH simulation results. Due to the lack of spatial symmetries, the grid must be a full 3D
grid. Moreover, since we have no a priori information on where the denser regions are located, it is best to choose an
adaptive grid that automatically forms smaller cells in denser regions. The grid will take longer to construct, but the
simulation run will be faster and more accurate than if you would use a regular grid.

For this tutorial simulation, select an octtree grid. The grid must enclose most of the dust in the system so its size
must be adjusted to the configuration space of the input data. For the \c eagle_xxx.dat particle data files, you should
specify a cube of 40 kpc in each direction, centered on the origin.

For this tutorial simulation, acceptable values for the grid refinement level are a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 7.
The maximum fraction of dust mass in each cell may be set to a value of \f$2\times 10^{-5}\f$. For high-quality
simulations, you will need to raise the maximum level to 10 or more, and the maximum fraction of dust mass should be
set to a smaller (and thus more stringent) value. This will result in an octtree with more and smaller cells,
increasing accuracy as well as execution time. Leave the other parameters (some of which are not shown) to their
default values.

\verbatim
   ...
   Possible choices for the dust emissivity type:
      1. Modified blackbody dust emissivity (assumes LTE conditions)
      2. Transient heating dust emissivity (with full non-LTE treatment)
 ? Enter one of these numbers or zero to select none [0,2] (1): 2
   Possible choices for the dust library mechanism:
      1. A dust library that calculates the emissivity for every dust cell
      2. A dust library with a one-dimensional grid of emissivity entries
      3. A dust library with a two-dimensional grid of emissivity entries
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (1): 2
 ? Enter the number of field strength grid points [10,10000000] (500): 5000
 ? Do you want to include dust self-absorption? [yes/no] (no):
 ? Do you want to output FITS files displaying the dust temperature distribution? [yes/no] (yes):
\endverbatim

As soon as a simulation includes a dust system, dust absorption and scattering are automatically enabled. For a
panchromatic simulation you can also enable thermal emission by the dust. To enable thermal emission, select one of the
dust emissivity options (see next paragraph). To disable thermal emission, enter zero to select "no dust emissivity".
If the simulation's wavelength range includes MIR or FIR bands, dust emission is most likely relevant. If the
simulation covers UV and optical bands only, dust emission is most likely irrelevant.

With the default "modified blackbody" dust emissivity option, thermal emission is calculated under the assumption of
local thermal equilibrium (LTE). Alternatively you can select "transient heating" dust emissivity, which supports
non-equilibrium (NLTE) dust emission by stochastically heated grains. This is a lot more resource-intensive but
produces more realistic results for the NIR and MIR wavelengths. When a dust grid contains many cells, it becomes
computationally intensive to calculate the NLTE dust emission for the radiation field in each and every dust cell. To
help address this issue, <tt>SKIRT</tt> offers a library mechanism that selects a small set of radiation fields
relevant to the range detected in the dust grid, performs the thermal emission calculation for each of these library
entries, and then maps each dust grid cell to one of these entries. There are versions of the library mechanism with a
1D and a 2D grid. The default mechanism simply calculates the thermal emission for every cell, so it is not really a
library.

Finally, if dust emission is enabled, you can also enable dust self-absorption, implying a self-consistent calculation
of the dust temperature through an iterative (and time-consuming) procedure. The relevance of dust self-absorption
depends on the optical depth of the modeled system: if there is a modest amount of dust, the system is transparent to
long-wavelength radiation, so self-absorption by dust is negligible. If the system is rather opaque, it will absorb
also mid- and far-infrared radiation, so self-absorption might be important.

For this tutorial simulation, use the "transient heating" dust emissivity and a 1D dust library with 5000 entries.
Disable dust self-absorption since it has no effect for this optically-thin model. Leave the other parameters to their
default values.

\section TutorialHydroSphInst Instrument system

\verbatim
   ...
   Possible choices for item #1 in the instruments list:
      1. A basic instrument that outputs the total integrated flux as an SED
      2. A basic instrument that outputs the total flux in every pixel as a data cube
         ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers or zero to terminate the list [0,5] (3): 1
 ? Enter the name for this instrument: i90
 ? Enter the distance to the system ]0 Mpc,.. Mpc[: 10
 ? Enter the inclination angle of the detector [0 deg,180 deg] (0 deg): 90
 ? Enter the azimuth angle of the detector [-360 deg,360 deg] (0 deg): 0
 ? Enter the position angle of the detector [-360 deg,360 deg] (0 deg): 0
   Possible choices for item #2 in the instruments list:
     1. A basic instrument that outputs the total integrated flux as an SED
     2. A basic instrument that outputs the total flux in every pixel as a data cube
        ...

   Possible choices for item #3 in the instruments list:

\endverbatim

For this tutorial, configure two instruments of the type that outputs the total integrated flux as an %SED. Specify
two different inclinations, for example 90 and 0 degrees, and a distance to the system of 10 Mpc.

\section TutorialHydroSphPhot Photon packages

\verbatim
 ? Enter the number of photon packages per wavelength [0,1e15] (1e6): 1e5
\endverbatim

To limit the run time for this tutorial, set the number of photon packages to \f$10^5\f$. This number is sufficient to
produce an approximate %SED for the simple galaxy model, but it would be insufficient to produce resolved images with
an acceptable signal to noise level.

\section TutorialHydroSphRun Running the simulation

After all questions have been answered, <tt>SKIRT</tt> writes out the resulting ski file and terminates. Start
<tt>SKIRT</tt> again, this time specifying the name of the new \em ski file on the command line, to actually perform
the simulation. If the input data files are not in your current directory, you can specify the input directory on the
<tt>SKIRT</tt> command line. For example:

\verbatim
skirt -i ../in PanEagle
\endverbatim

\section TutorialHydroSphOutput Output files

Most of the output files for this tutorial are similar to those already described for the "Monochromatic simulation
of a dusty disk galaxy" tutorial. This section describes the output file types that are new to this tutorial.

Because the geometry in this simulation is truly three-dimensional (i.e. it has no axial or spherical symmetries),
there are now three cuts through the dust density (one along each of the coordinate planes) rather than two.
There are also some additional files describing aspects of the dust system that make sense only for panchromatic
simulations:

- \c PanEagle_ds_mix_0_size.dat is a text file with grain size information for each of the dust populations in the
  dust mixture configured for this simulation. For this tutorial simulation, there are 20 populations in total
  (5 each for graphites, silicates, neutral PAHs, and ionized PAHs).
- \c PanEagle_ds_celltemps.dat is a text data file listing an indicative dust temperature in each
  cell of the dust grid; this information can be used to plot a histogram of the dust temperature
  distribution. The indicative temperature in each cell is a mass-weighted average of the equilibrium temperatures
  for all dust populations in the dust mixture. The assumption that all dust grains are in local thermal equilibrium
  with the radiation field is not always justified, which is why we call these temperature values "indicative".
- \c PanEagle_ds_tempxy.fits & \c xz are FITS data files containing 1024 x 1024 pixel maps of the indicative
  dust temperature in a coordinate plane, across the total extension of the dust grid. In fact, these files contain
  a separate map for each dust population. The correspondance between the index of the map or frame in the FITS file
  and the represented dust population can be found in the \c PanEagle_ds_mix_0_size.dat text file.

The instruments used in this tutorial each produce an %SED file:
- \c PanEagle_iNN_sed.dat is a short text data file representing the spectral energy distribution of the photon
  packages detected by the instrument; there are two columns (wavelength, flux) that can easily be plotted.

\section TutorialHydroSphPlot Plotting SEDs and dust grids

<tt>PTS</tt> offers a simple way to create a PDF file plotting the SEDs produced by a <tt>SKIRT</tt> simulation. The
SEDs for all instruments are combined on the same figure. After the simulation has completed, make sure that the output
directory is your current directory, and simply enter the command "pts plotseds". The PDF file is placed next to the
original data files with a similar name (the instrument name is removed and the filename extension is replaced by
.pdf):

\verbatim
$ pts plotseds
...
Starting plotseds...
Created PDF grid plot file __/PanEagle_sed.pdf
Finished plotseds
$
\endverbatim

To adjust the axis ranges, open the Python script <code>~/PTS/pts/do/core/plotseds.py</code> in a text editor.
Uncomment and update the lines provided for this purpose, and then rerun "pts plotseds". For example:

\verbatim
# a value of None means that the axis is autoscaled;
# alternatively specify a range through a tuple with min and max values
xlim = None
ylim = None
#xlim = ( 5e-2, 1e3 )
ylim = ( 1e-13, 3e-12 )
\endverbatim

Similarly, <tt>PTS</tt> offers a command to create PDF files containing a plot of the spatial grid structure used in a
<tt>SKIRT</tt> simulation. Again with the <tt>SKIRT</tt> output directory as your current directory, enter the command
"pts plotgrids". The PDF files are placed next to the original data files with the same name except for the .pdf
extension:

\verbatim
$ pts plotgrids
...
Starting: plotgrids
Created PDF grid plot file __/PanEagle_ds_gridxy.pdf
Created PDF grid plot file __/PanEagle_ds_gridxz.pdf
Created PDF grid plot file __/PanEagle_ds_gridyz.pdf
Created PDF grid plot file __/PanEagle_ds_gridxyz.pdf
Finished plotgrids
$
\endverbatim

\section TutorialHydroSphRes Interpreting simulation results

Open \c PanEagle_ds_convergence.dat in a text editor and check the dust grid convergence metrics. For this simulation,
there is a significant discrepancy between the expected and the actual values (about 20% for the dust mass) for two
reasons. Firstly, some of the imported gas particles (and thus the dust derived from those particles) lie outside the
domain of our dust grid. And secondly, the dust grid has a fairly low resolution resulting in a significant
discretization error. These resolution effects are also apparent when comparing the theoretical and gridded dust
density cuts (e.g. \c PanEagle_ds_trhoxy.fits versus \c PanEagle_ds_grhoxy.fits) in a FITS viewer such as DS9.

Also review the grid structure plots generated with <tt>PTS</tt> (see previous section). The cuts through the grid
(e.g. \c PanEagle_ds_gridxz.pdf) clearly show that the octree algorithm places smaller cells in areas with a higher
dust density. The three-dimensional plot (\c PanEagle_ds_gridxyz.pdf) is less interesting because, to limit the amount
of data, <tt>SKIRT</tt> outputs only the cells in the topmost levels. This plot is more useful for grids with even
fewer cells (which can serve as an illustration but are usually not sufficiently resolved).

It is also instructive to review the temperature maps, e.g. \c PanEagle_ds_tempxy.fits. As mentioned in the previous
section, there is a separate map for each dust population. The correspondance between the index of the map or frame in
the FITS file and the represented dust population can be found in the \c PanEagle_ds_mix_0_size.dat text file. Note the
temperature differences between the various dust populations.

Finally, the SEDs plotted with PTS (see previous section) in the file \c PanEagle_sed.pdf represent the actual "result"
of this simulation. Note the form of the %SED in the three important wavelength regimes. The UV, optical and NIR (up to
4 \f$\mu\f$m) are dominated by the stellar emission, modulated by dust exinction. The extinction differs between
viewing angles because of the geometry of the galaxy. Emission from stochastically heated dust grains causes the
irregular form of the MIR spectrum (up to 25 \f$\mu\f$m), and the dust continuum emission dominates the FIR and sub-mm.
The dust emission is isotropic because the dust is essentially transparent at these wavelenghts. The small differences
between the two curves in the 10 to 30 \f$\mu\f$m range are most likely caused by discretization errors (a
low-resolution dust grid; a small number of photon packages; not that many wavelengths).
